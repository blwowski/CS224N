You know what I do is write for kids, and, in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, the most read in the U.S.
And I always tell people I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or leather leather -- and nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany generally is something that fell into you somewhere.
You just have to turn to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle of which I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the <unk> in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
When I was able to tap up every week in the bathroom of the children, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom of the living room.
I did it on secret.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the <unk> I was the need to start working on organizations who fought AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half the night I got a phone call from that <unk> the <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that adults never got to know us.
You could go to Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've already found.
And I have to tell you I have pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to tell me with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see it, and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found that one place, the <unk> and we take care of her family, because necessary, me.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as a woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult arrived at <unk> became a <unk> box and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about it was made in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy today that I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was mind.
My heart can quickly, I was trying to understand what was in front of me.
The <unk> around me around the water almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't even longer think that this was a <unk> on another <unk> <unk> year after year.
<unk> are born when they get out of glaciers or they break down the walls of ice.
Every iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to give themselves and hold to the end, while others can't afford more and become a <unk> of <unk> passion.
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated and separated and alone, as well as we see ourselves as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
And as a <unk> then I'm breathing his ancestral atmosphere.
As a eardrum <unk> releases freshwater rich in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I walk up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits.
It's not the death when you're <unk> it's not an end, but one continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Some of the ice from the <unk> that I photograph is very <unk> it has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are from a iceberg that I photographed at <unk> Greenland.
It's a little bit frequent to get to witness an B15 iceberg here.
Here you are.
You can see on the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the ship has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is an iceberg on average size.
<unk> of water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so they <unk> the B15 iceberg on a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single <unk>
So, two couples every single baby.
I don't want you to be too much in the details of conception, because if they stop to think about it, I know, they're not going to pay attention to me.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and sperm joins the X chromosome.
And in the other case, the X chromosome is joined by the X chromosome.
Both of them <unk> and you start life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my activity that I could find two roles.
In one of my roles, I work with the history of anatomy.
I'm <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people <unk> the anatomy -- so that we have human bodies and <unk> how have they considered body fluids -- the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role that performance is in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes <unk> <unk> people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with identical twins two people inside one body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much more low than the average.
And I've been working with many cases of people with <unk> sex, whose physics of physics doesn't fit in male and female <unk>
In general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> takes a lot of ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways of having a sex that's not being done in the male or female forms.
For example, there is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> which is the <unk> gene from the chromosome. And it tells the <unk> that we all have in the life that are <unk>
And then, in life -- the testicles make testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, the body doesn't react to itself.
This is <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high levels of testosterone but <unk>
As a result, your body develops in following a female course.
When you <unk> the baby has a little bit of a child.
It's a girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing up and developing your breast period -- when somebody realizes something is going on.
And after you've got to ask them tests and realize that instead of <unk> and <unk> it actually has <unk> and the y <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not that way.
Women like men, we have in the body of something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most women like me, and I consider a woman who is not known for the <unk> structure, I think, being a typical woman, most women like me are sensitive to <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, somebody like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> that has the <unk> syndrome to the <unk>
So sex is a complicated thing. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a way that can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19 year-old boy born and raised as a <unk> had girlfriend, and she had her sex with her, he was carrying a life as a boy and I had just found out she had ovaries and uterus.
He had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
It had been published and in the uterus -- the areolar glands were so active that, essentially created a male hormonal environment.
As a consequence, the genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component in typically male component.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk>
And it was at age 19, when he started to have medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, it was a woman inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with the 20th chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> which is to say, they have <unk> tissue wrapped up in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that kids with these kinds of bodies -- whether they're <unk> twins or <unk> or <unk> they are <unk> it is not to be able to provide them from a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason they tested for various surgeries is that they're a threat for our social categories.
The system is based usually in the idea that a particular anatomy brings together a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is having a <unk> identity -- <unk> being a black means to have African anatomy in terms of <unk>
One simplistic idea.
And when you presented with a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of very romantic.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children who are born as two people inside one body.
The highest recent case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> put his sex in the <unk> <unk> Olympics.
A lot of journalists called to ask, "How do you test them are going to figure out whether to say, <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there is no such test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't traces a <unk> line between men and women or men and <unk> and women and <unk> are we who map that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through science, the more we need to admit that these categories -- until we thought were very successful <unk> categories that are <unk> directly with <unk> categories -- are much more <unk> than they <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that turns out much more complicated than the ethical terminology is.
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with the chimps.
What are the fact that the fact of the <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we go back in science we get more and more in a uncomfortable zone that we have to recognize that the <unk> categories are probably too much too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and at the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which one body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to deal with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of him put a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved still not to it.
So if you stopped moving it out.
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from one body and put them on another body.
And as a result, we should deal with a prisoner's dilemma to actually determine somebody's death, and this puts us in a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe you think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it gets me nervous.
So what we found is that these categories are much more fragile than we were thinking about that.
You know, from the point of view of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I am a fervent <unk> of <unk> parents.
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical in what they did, that I meet every single time watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not by the music, which is totally <unk>
It's because of what happened in <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> were, for me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept.
And as you all remember, what our parents <unk> was the idea of <unk> the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The old world did not know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth to birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that it was given to political power by the blood of blood passed from the grandfather to the father and then the son, and so on.
<unk> was rejected by rejected that idea and replaced it for a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field, and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the common anatomy and not the <unk> differences, that was very radical.
And they were in part of it, because they formed part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it remains very clear, if you look at the history of <unk> <unk> that many were very interested in science and in the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> of <unk> explanations -- and therefore they would bring the concept of power to be passed through a vague idea of birth.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of <unk> talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, they were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future movement movement movement.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And the women are <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man.
And again, people of color that we <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and again, <unk>
We see the same with the <unk> movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at <unk> we have to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But so, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For instance, I don't want to give a fish the same rights that a human.
I don't want to say that we should be <unk> to anatomy.
I don't want to say that for the age of five years, they should be allowed to have sexual relationships or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me to make sense and that I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why to keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things: I first heard this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, TED was born three months before time: June 1 1980.
Henry, the other thing was born in term: was the March March of 1980.
For the only fact that we had been born three months before Mary was attributed to all the rights three months before I was Henry -- the right to sexual consent, the right to the vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different age, but because it was born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, the virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> for virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> from the <unk> of the Mary that Mary doesn't have to worry.
Mary, you don't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in every states, for example.
Henry can be married in all states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So they still do <unk> categories than in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is: What do we do now that science went so much in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time as I sometimes feel like science is <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It seems that what happens in our culture is kind of a kind of an evolutionary attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example, Texas at some point has decided that to marry a man has no <unk> and that to marry a woman you have to have the y <unk>
Now, in practice they don't do tests by encouraging people.
But this is also very strange because the story I told you to the beginning of <unk> syndrome to the <unk>
If we look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea looks like a good one."
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be able to focus on this to <unk> rights to people, because I have to admit that I know that I know from some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some of the <unk> that I know can make more intelligent decisions and <unk> about their sexual relationships that people I know.
So how do you put the theme of <unk> content.
It turns out very hard.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI version.
Do we really want to get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current thinking in relation to the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to less than being killed at less than being killed at less than a sex change in which case it allows you to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon who was talking about a couple of years ago that I had done to give birth twins <unk> to then pick them out, and so they would take their name.
But when the phone asked him, he asked the reason for the operation, it was a very <unk> operation, told me that in that other country these kids would be very embarrassed and therefore had to do it.
So what I said, "Well, it's considered the political target instead of <unk> <unk>
America offers huge possibilities to people to be who are <unk> to change the state of the state.
So I think we have to be in the head.
Well, to finish up I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy would be, or as it might be, if we had given more involvement in the <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical for a feminist, and that is that I think there may be different ideas coming out of different <unk> <unk> particular if there are people thinking in a group.
For years, since I've been interested in the <unk> I've been interested in asking the sexual difference.
And one of the things that have been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and working in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advice that I knew I was interested in this <unk> <unk> I was considered <unk> as a <unk> made me <unk>
<unk> what is women <unk>
And I thought, "It's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
Feminism is to do with unpicking the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing female in the <unk>
But the more I've thought about the question, the more I've been thinking about in the question, there is something <unk>
I mean, there might be something on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the parents were very aware to find the way to protect people from the state, it is possible that, to have gotten more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we make it <unk> democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect, let's think about what we do with each other.
Thank you.
In the year 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family will think of where they want to go live and work, I have the ability to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, at this point, we're far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth much more than their building cost.
So we could easily address the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But they simply replaced by buildings in apartments.
Imagine that half of those who would want to live in apartments would be owners and than half of them still will not get to do it.
You could try to increase the ability to increase in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid the challenges and the distractions of the construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a completely new place, and build a whole new apartment building, always and when the rules of that place will build the construction instead of putting <unk>
And so I proposed that governments would have new reform zones for <unk> and I gave them a name, cities under <unk>
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reshape Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 people would come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened by a Chinese constitutional crisis.
In the following election <unk> <unk> <unk> was imposed by a platform in which they were <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked her to <unk> it was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of evidence with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of norms -- like those rules that tell you that you can't go and pick all the current residents of apartments.
So let's get a lot of attention to new technologies, but you need so much of technologies like <unk> norms for <unk> and usually they are the rules that keep us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him to <unk> a link with the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They called me.
And they said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami in a hotel room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are about the cities, much more valuable than their <unk> cost.
And I used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York City, which in some cases, it's worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> <unk>
And the talk described in very simple terms, that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> terrain -- a <unk> that will be able to fold up the rules that will be stored there and an option for people to choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> I called and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way for our country forward.
He asked me to go to <unk> and I would talk about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that is measuring at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
All the world <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform, and he said, "Professor <unk> thank you very much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> <unk>
I have this in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be an option in a city that could go to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of kilometers away to the North.
And also new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government would need help from countries that would be able to benefit from the countries that they would help them establish and make the <unk> rules so that everybody could trust that the <unk> actually <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could be quite easily a thousand square miles.
And soon after, 19 in January, they voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and to add a constitutional available available to make these special regions of development.
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis, the voting in Congress in favor of this constitutional <unk> was <unk> to one.
All of the games, all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
To <unk> in the Constitution, you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17, he passed the way over in another voting and <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting season, at the age of 24 of February, a delegation of about 30 <unk> went to the two places in the world that are most interested in engaging in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new center of the city that is being built in Korea, is bigger than the Boston center.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after four years later, getting the <unk>
The other country in the building of cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this in a practical way, this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> <unk> and would allow the <unk> to operate under an external legal system.
A country has been committed to allowing his Supreme Court to be the ultimate court for this new <unk> system.
There's urban planners and builders which are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know you've already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are lots of companies that would want to be installed in <unk> especially in a place of free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change the other place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave behind their family to go get a job -- sometimes they're mothers who have to earn money to just eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even kids are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What does it look like to think about insisting so that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> asked me to say, "Thank you?"
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what's inside there, I'm going to make a confession to public -- and I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, and most recently, to photograph and publish in my blog suits and colorful and different for every time.
But I didn't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets and female stores.
Oh, thank you.
The second <unk> allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to know people <unk> by normally my money is going to be good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I'm going to be in my size?
I'm going to love color.
It's less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I <unk>
To go back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what we would take for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what is someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven base pairs of clothes and nothing else.
This is exactly what I've put in my <unk>
I imagined that I would be able to find everything else I want to use after you get here to Palm <unk>
And because I don't know you like the woman who walks by TED in <unk>  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this bright.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look right.
You can almost always see a phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All together, including the <unk> took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've ever used in the week.
<unk> the color is power.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
Just yourself.
If you get rid of the right people -- not only are you going to give you, you know, <unk>
<unk>
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the <unk> or I remember their little seven years.
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you're okay with something, it's almost safe you are.
And if you think you don't look good at something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years that I really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside, you don't see that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> a universal truth about six words for you: <unk> <unk> go with it.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style and unique <unk> is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and again when people were approaching me this week simply by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously all of this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn about this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need to be emotionally <unk> to these things, because back in the corner, there will always be another crazy suit -- colorful and brilliant <unk> if there's a little love in my heart and <unk>
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left-hand side, which is the logic and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure <unk> <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be someone that's completely logical.
This would be someone that's totally intuitive.
So where do you get your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> by one of these ends, but I think for most members of this audience, their brain is something like that, with a big <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're another <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum physical physicists -- we need a lot of logic to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need quite a intuition to make the experiments really work.
So how do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put together with them and then we see how they react. And then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
You can have been intuition that you can have developed with the passage of the years is the one that says one thing can be only in one place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> the <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing on a parking bar.
It was a small kid and he didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet you play with that pole in a parking lot taught him a valuable lesson, and it's that big things don't allow them to get them and stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except be a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking bars, they play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of things really rare -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called the theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point, it was the physics of a few years -- you need of quantum mechanics to describe those tiny particles.
But you don't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because it's not often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not too much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit well to my logical part.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the small particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then I should not all follow the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't be.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see it's been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the piece of metal I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's right in the center.
And then here we make a very big approach, the little metal <unk>
What we see is a little bit of metal with a springboard with a springboard and that stands in a platform.
And then I made this almost the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip and I started working all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this <unk> and to make this <unk> <unk> which is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be on a elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people get up to make those things, because I don't want them to do it, you know, you know, in fact, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The fellow on the journey of inanimate objects are not only people -- it's also the light that they <unk> and the wind that goes on side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to be <unk> according to quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights -- then we introduced a <unk> and pulled out all the air -- and then we'll put it into a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, by being only in the <unk> the little metal piece is free of acting as usual.
So we measured their movements.
We found that it moved in very weird ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, he was <unk> and the way it <unk> was like a breathing in this way -- like a <unk> that will expand and <unk>
And when you give it an electrical <unk> we were able to make it happen, and you don't go at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillion atoms that make that piece of metal are still still and at the same time those same atoms moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that each atom is in two different places at the same time, which means the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
True thing.
But was the shame penalty room in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between one single atom and that little piece of metal is kind of the same as the difference between that little bit of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece can be in two different places, why not you as well?
I mean, it's my logical part.
So imagine if you were in various places at the same time, what would that be?
How to acting your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we put it, and we turned the lights up and we looked inside the box, and we saw that metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects on the elevator actually are just quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not quite true.
It's more profound than that, it's deeper.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, they literally define who you are, and that's the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago I was doing a job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head that's here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months and so on.
A lot of negotiations and stories, they were doing it with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories from why we did.
I think my own story is explaining just on this slide and this is access.
I grew up in India.
I had a lot of education from a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and going into museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
So I better show you the demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've taken from their launch.
So, let's go on to <unk>
Look around every museum that there is.
Is the gallery <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
In fact, I'm going to get into one of my favorite ones, by the <unk> the art of New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click on it, and we click on it, we're already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move over there and they <unk>
Do you want to navigate the <unk>
We open the plane the top, and with one click, we jump inside.
They're inside that you want to go at the end of the room.
It's going to be <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk>
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information from <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million <unk>
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you really do with 10,000 million <unk>
You can zoom in around in a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to get to <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems <unk>
I came in, and I discovered that kids were actually playing something.
And I was talking about a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is hitting a <unk> on a Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get to get even more deep down and you'll see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take the image, so you'll actually see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're rapidly going to jump over again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find out detail.
But what if you want to look at the <unk>
And if you want to see how van Gogh actually created this piece of <unk>
It increases it and truth that you can do it.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot of things over here, but I don't have a time of <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives it the same.
You can online to create your own museum, create its own collection of all these images.
It's very simple, we go -- I've created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we just did a zooming around.
It's about <unk> at the National Portrait Gallery.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what they feel at contemplating these <unk> works.
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all amazing things don't really come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they even come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that has been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital environment does justice to its artwork and that is represented properly online.
And the great question that you do today is, "You have done this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of this is a <unk>
In our lab, we call it genetic design.
Let me tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian <unk> all the kids in Italy grow up with this picture on his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened something very interesting in the race of Formula 1 in the last two decades.
For some time, if you wanted to win a career in Formula 1, I took a budget and you would take it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough -- one was good enough -- one made the career.
This is what the engineering is, in the engineering, it became real control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
What's interesting is that the systems of control in real time are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're getting computers to the open.
And as <unk> they're starting to respond differently and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As you can tell, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> for the end of the year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start to <unk>
In a way, it's like all of the existing atoms to become sensors and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction as we humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense it's almost like the old <unk> <unk>
You know, when you Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> he said that at the end of the hammer took the hammer and threw it up to the Moses -- you can still see a little <unk> <unk> and said <unk> <unk> non <unk> which is not <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just about <unk> <unk> in the idea of taking the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer with the 2006.
It was the year when Italy won the World Cup in the World.
Maybe some of the remember, they were playing Italy and France, and at the end, the <unk> gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at the activity of the Web <unk>
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning before the game.
The line line is on the top.
And in the early afternoon, there are people here and doing <unk>
It starts <unk>
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a rapid call and go to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First of all, a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
<unk> Italy, yeah!
That night everyone went to the center.
There you see the great peak.
The next day everyone went to the center of the <unk> team and the first minister then.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the <unk> people are going to be <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the city of the city in a way that we couldn't do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but of things we use and consume.
Today, we know all about the side of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up on the Mac, how it <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in its shift through the system.
We started with some volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year ago to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are all <unk>
Then we put a little chip, which is a <unk> into the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized there is a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with a lot less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're going on complicated things, and there is a lot of need.
But the other thing that we believe is that if you look at all the days that the cup that we <unk> is still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle we dropped a day still still there.
If we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and a lot of other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is push over the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of water in public space, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology can, like, new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop, was to imagine that you have a <unk> and <unk> valves.
It was believed as a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If you fall down the pixels you can write in them, show patterns, images, <unk>
And by <unk> the curtain will open up so that we can see in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor <unk>
He liked it a lot.
And we set up a commission to design the building to the entrance to the <unk>
We call it <unk> <unk>
The entire building is made of water.
There is no gates and no windows, but when you find it open to you that you can see it.
The roof is also covered with water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you go down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like this case.
Those days will always be someone, in the winter, when you go down the roof, somebody who said, "Let's get the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when you get down almost all the architecture of the architecture away.
Here's how it works.
You see the people who are <unk> by what's happening inside.
And here I'm just myself trying to not try and test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that was going to open to let you happen, but a building that was still making cuts and holes of water, and you had to jump to not wet.
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about how people will give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels the pixels of water and of the projections of them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine you could have little helicopters in the air and that each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, which moves with others in synchrony.
Could we form this cloud,
A sort of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or in three dimensions, that what changes is light, not the position of the <unk>
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appear on different scales and sizes, different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that would be a cloud of pixels in 3D pixels to which you can zoom in, and you can see from very different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to the bottom and form a <unk> as it before.
When the light goes up, the light looks like this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by a person.
We can have each pixel with a input that comes from people, from the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of <unk> today, the star of New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their 3D movements and use them as input to <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> the catch in different <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D <unk> as a movement.
It can <unk> all the movement.
You can walk along the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our physical environment as a <unk> nursery like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine we could make everybody <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think what's remarkable about the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we spend the physical world in the digital world.
We have digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign -- we can move from the digital world, from the <unk> of the networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may be we wanted to use it to design and make a <unk>
That means something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how will we go from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in the collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud.
And those particles are water, while in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but covered with <unk>
You can move inside, and you can move inside, having different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to serve to share the main moments of the Olympics in 2012, and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection to the community.
So it's both a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a new summit in London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than what they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in their genes, they could improve <unk> by more precise, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you might like to be in better form, will be stronger to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and sure of themselves?
How about good health?
Or maybe those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is the most important thing to you?
What do you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> from the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people will make creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> probably had to be the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many would you want memory?
A few more.
And the <unk> state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, the majority. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this, the world would be very different.
It's just imagination?
Or maybe be possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> which also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote an essay called "No biology, makes sense except to the light of the <unk>
But if you actually take biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
Does the other or to us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, right at one end, is, of course, the most interest in us.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees is about six or eight million years ago.
There have been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We've been here about <unk> years.
It might seem that we're very far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat the <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same protein, but it's the same protein, right?
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry on to the most bacteria we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> raises the <unk> you think about the <unk>
And the gut is a wonderful <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, wet <unk> is very <unk>
And we're going to provide all of the nutrients that they can want to have no effort from their part.
It's really like a fast way for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush <unk> towards the way.
But by others, we're a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest <unk> nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary equilibrium as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something maybe better as a <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one single <unk> and the human life, a little bit of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've got it.
When I was just teaching college I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and realized something fundamental about most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms, every cell just divided and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two two daughters of it.
But when organisms appear -- things start to change.
It leaves sexual reproduction.
And something very important: with the emergence of sexual reproduction that passes the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the death of the body goes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have a confession that when I was a college student, I thought, well, <unk> <unk> death by <unk> seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, every time I had more doubt.
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> that even <unk> in Las Vegas well in their 90 years.
And one night somebody hits his hotel door to hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him is a gorgeous <unk> <unk>
He looks at it and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
"It is good," "I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different target to the goal of the <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
He wanted us healthy.
I wanted to recover the health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is to pass the genome to the next <unk> adapted and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> rockets that are designed to send the genetic charge to the next level, and then let us go into the sea.
I think everybody <unk> the feeling that put <unk> Allen when he said, "I don't want to get the immortality for my work.
I want to <unk> not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily define longevity.
It doesn't necessarily define the biggest or the stronger or the faster and even the smartest and even the smartest and even the smartest person or even the smarter.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only test for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that would be able to survive if there were fish there, toxic fish in the <unk> yet they've managed to make that an inorganic environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if you go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution -- and in particular, if you look forward to the <unk> phase I would say there's a lot of possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the information underlying it would be that through medicine, first of all, we have known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and spread from the population.
And second of all, as a species, we have <unk> our environment so that we can adapt to ourselves as we adapt to it.
And by the way, we <unk> <unk> and so much that it is no longer possible to have the isolation necessary for us to happen.
A second possibility is that there's a evolution of the traditional kind of traditional guy, natural type of the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as we have a <unk> species, as a species, distant planets are going to have isolation and environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there's a third possibility, an overwhelming possibility -- intriguing and terrifying possibility.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and selected for us as individuals in the choices that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what you pick up on the individual and family level.
Think of it as well as possible to be able to choose not only sex, but in its own body to make the genetic settings to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce cancer risk or remove the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in their <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of change is going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990, 13 years old.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year of being done, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs from the human genome to a cost about 20,000 and a week.
Not a lot to be a lot to make the human genome to be done, and to be increasingly in the grasp of all.
You come up with those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not just going to protect us but they're going to induce <unk>
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in the course of a <unk> vaccine in a plant of <unk>
Can you imagine something good about the <unk>
That's actually today and in the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine then only two little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies but if they could change the cells in their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the newborn egg and give their children a better opportunity for a healthier life, remove the diabetes, remove the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then, that same <unk> technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease is going to allow us to also allow us to take a better memory -- a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could get it up with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a <unk> muscle faster than allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer.
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have turned the evolution of before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years and we can take it to 1,000 years, and maybe it was within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to them.
We're going to use these choices for a better society, more successful society.
Or, let's choose to selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us, but not for everybody else?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more uniform or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the most profound thing about all: we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom you need to make these <unk> decisions.
For better or for worse, and before I could make these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a unique seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight assistants at flight.
So immediately I looked at them, and they said, "There's no problem: Probably a few <unk>
The pilot had already collapsed the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot would reduce the plane with the Hudson River.
Mostly, that's not the road.
They would take the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and without <unk>
And then he said three words ...
The top three words ever heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk about the flight assistant.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before we die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get and I didn't do it, all the fences that I wanted to repair all the experiences that I've wanted to have and never have to do.
As I thought later on, I was a sentence, which is, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to hide anything in life.
And that urgency, that <unk> that is really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is the time I had the bridge George Washington, which wasn't a lot of -- I thought about, <unk> I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity I also give rise to my ego.
And I'm going to be the time that we were going to get into things that didn't matter with people who matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as a <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't try to have a reason to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock is <unk> <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces like you see in those <unk>
And as I was born, I had the feeling of, <unk> is not afraid of fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our lives.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness got into one single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children grow.
A month later, I was in a performance.
And to me, that was the whole reason to be in the world.
At that point I understood when I connect those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all of all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I gave myself a miracle, and I didn't die that day.
And they gave me another gift, which was the possibility to look at the future and go back and live in another way.
You guys are flying today, the challenge you can imagine that the same thing happens in your plane -- and please not be the way -- but imagine, and how do you think about it.
What are you going to think about doing because they think they're going to live <unk>
How would your relationships change and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been blessed in life with many projects.
But the biggest thing that I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day she came home after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today <unk> has total <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
Her work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation, so that graffiti is something very intricate that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
And so we decided that we were going to take it to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met her brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are they going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him, and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second, it's not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> is not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be someone important and have a very good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Somebody looked at the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way, they will make it with your <unk>
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I presented with the only desire to deliver a check and instead of that signed a check that I had no idea how he was going to <unk>
I committed to her brother and her father there at the very precise moment, "All right, this is the Tony <unk> is going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it's kind of ridiculous that someone who has so much inside it can't afford it.
So I talked about a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research -- which has a technology that allows you to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer you draw on that and record negative space.
So they're going around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
They start with sexual organs, then with bad words, then with the attacks of Bush and in the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a life cycle in his <unk>
And so the journey started.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a year later, and a lot of organization actually move things on one side to another we had achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the gates of the insurance companies, and we got a machine to make it <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy -- you get an email from him, and you say, "You don't know. This guy is <unk>
The other thing that we did was bring seven programmers from all the world's <unk> from all the corners of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, and I went to the back of the back of these hackers and these hackers and programmers and programmers and programmers and <unk> they took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought that we would do something completely stupid and that when you were born, they would have taken off the frames of the walls and their place would be <unk>
But for two weeks later, we went to the <unk> of <unk> my son was part of my dog -- and we created this.
It's called <unk>
They're a pair of <unk> <unk> we buy in the <unk> of <unk> Beach, a copper wire and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
We take a camera <unk> the <unk> we put it into an LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- and that is that you see, <unk> we published the <unk> code, the software goes down.
And we created a device that doesn't have limitation at all.
There's no insurance company to say "No."
There is no hospital I can say "No."
Anyone with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using just your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we came back to the room of <unk>
I love this picture because this is the room of another person and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And then after a year of planning, two weeks of programming the whole night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life and is looking through the support system.
We ran the bed to you that I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the outside hospital.
And he went back to the first time in front of her family and friends -- and you can imagine what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust into the parking lot so we felt like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what we were like, "This was the first time I drew it in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and would get me out there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our <unk>
That's what keeps us in motion.
And we have a long way to go with this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Somebody with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to adapt and make it faster and robust.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the greatest inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up from closing the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> of <unk> at the center of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- they're all going to be there.
It's going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you see something that's not possible, do it possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- the computer, the computer, the microphone, the microphone, the <unk> was nothing possible at a certain moment.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with recognition technology -- I just recognized something and I was fascinated with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want all of us to do every day when we find something that we feel like to do. If it's not right now, <unk> And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years <unk> in situations usually very difficult and at the same time a dangerous one.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a dangerous <unk>
<unk> in areas of hard and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days to have just fun in the beginning, a very dangerous thing in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I've been focusing on situations in how awful with the only goal to treat.
So when I knew that I was going to come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and participate I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you can have heard of it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a record for <unk>
I sent some text messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I volunteered the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What I had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what and as content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it into ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But said this, it's a very good <unk> opportunity.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a title in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy your name.
If you had asked me a year ago I had never been able to do it with certainty.
But in the new film I'm working on, we looked at the world of marketing, of <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've been involved in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could tell me, nothing could be so hard or as dangerous as you go into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that tries to be <unk> the marketing and the advertising, and that the whole film was <unk> with <unk> and marketing and advertising.
The film is going to be called "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that all of the top up at the bottom of the end, has a brand images, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title of the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk>
I'm a <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the brand X in the title -- but we're going to make sure that we can burn all the categories that we can in the film.
Maybe you get a shoe and it becomes the biggest shoe that you've got <unk>
The biggest car that you've driven in "The largest film ever <unk> the best drink that you've got <unk> of "The largest film ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is also to show the brands as part of life, make them <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The whole goal of the whole film is transparency.
You'll see all the process in this movie.
That's the whole idea full of the whole film to end.
And I would love to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's funny because it's the first time I hear that -- it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> is going to be the people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> Don't <unk> David <unk> how much money does it need to do this?
MS: A million and a half million <unk> Very <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard at meeting with them, but that certainly is going to be worth convincing a couple of big <unk>
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie is going to look at us as a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> for the film or to be I?
JK: So the two things.
MS: -- it means you're not very optimistic.
So, I would ask myself, I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> <unk>
MK: We have to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go, <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought that <unk> was meant to have a conversation out of the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know about your <unk>
MS: And this was, one by one, all of these companies disappeared.
None of them want to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything about this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to introduce the product to as many people as possible, to do that as many people saw it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the separate media is not the idea to tell with that new vehicle that is going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this.
Actually, no, there was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this picture.
See, when you look for <unk> images in Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that were introduced.
I like your <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> which is characterized by visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices being the last line perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president -- the <unk> even the CEOs of the <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to it reality, it turns out a sudden changes.
But why? Well, transparency day --  -- like that weird bear that still follows <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird rural way.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> an entire bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started to talk to companies and tell you that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want you to be <unk> <unk>
We want you to make a story, but you would say, <unk> <unk>
See, when I was a kid, and my father <unk> me in some lie -- and there is him looking at me as a single <unk> saying, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, it's my story, and it's the <unk>
As you can see, this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized that I would have to go through my own, I would have to take off the proxy and go to companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to see is suddenly -- and that I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make a big, huge giant movies and others who make small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make films of big Hollywood movies say that the reason their films have so much success to the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent movies say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say "Are you very cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little nervous.
And I want to help you to help you.
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there's one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> of <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man to <unk> that solid, <unk> on bar, like it.
That's the general look generally.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at it.
Karen Frank: We are a small brand.
<unk> the kind of little little films that <unk> are rather a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that have other brands.
So do things like that, you know, remind people to be the reason why this is interested.
MS: What words would use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
KF: That's a great question.
Woman: Green technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in your <unk>
Man: We talk about something bold <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps you.
How do we keep you fresh longer, more <unk> more <unk> more <unk>
Things like those who <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common kind of guy.
I need to talk to the man in the street, people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Volunteer: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like a good thing.
Volunteer: revive the 1980s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of the colors, so many gray colors, and things like that.
They usually carry on the sun sunglasses, or I like the crystals and the like.
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In part <unk> partly <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pet pet guy.
They were taking toys to pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my small sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx out because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: Brands <unk> failed.
Is that anything?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, not all of us can be acquired Tom, but I often get away at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, somebody who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that <unk> personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yes. The first picture is a familiar photograph.
A: <unk> a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your form of being.
MS: These are ways to see the world.
A: <unk> that world.
MS: That world -- I think your world is the world where you <unk> like the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come back and start in a place and in my case start and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about.
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I'd like to be me.
I like different things.
I like things like <unk> I like the weird stuff.
A: <unk> <unk> for what is that?
What is the <unk> What phase is <unk>
Why is it important? What is <unk>
I got a little bit about that.
<unk> little more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be afraid.
MS:
A: thank you for your patience.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what it's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of crazy things about this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides of it, but you know, in your personality of <unk> the Morgan Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They <unk> very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are just going to lie in one of their strong points or the other rather than focusing on both.
Many companies tend to -- and it's the <unk> nature of avoiding the things that they're not <unk> to avoid fear, those items, and you actually make it positive and make you become positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are.
The first here is the <unk> Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> brands and conscious brands that have gone and come up but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS:
If somebody asks you to take your identity identity, your brand, your brand, what would that be?
You're a <unk> you're somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you rather a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> attributes are like being playful to be cool like <unk> contemporary -- <unk> <unk> or bold as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or mystic <unk>
Or are you more <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
You're in traditional place, traditional <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're reliable, stable, familiar, safe, safe, <unk> <unk> or wise -- like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mostly because they wouldn't have control over the final product.
We were allowed to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this film of how we now use the magnetic resonance to identify the <unk> centers in the brain both for commercial marketing and for films.
We went to San Paulo where they have banned advertising in the air.
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there is no wall, no <unk> nothing.
And we went to school districts where companies are getting into the way in schools with health problems in the U.S.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects that I've had the most important response or the ones that I've had more success are the ones that I've been doing with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They went to the <unk> they took their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly to the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to challenge people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And what has he gone? They had success?
Well, since the film was sent into the <unk> Festival we take a look.
According to <unk> the film was sent out in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> and press, no TV.
The movie is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
They haven't been presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has begun to win momentum.
And it's not wrong because almost all of the agencies that we're talking about is telling their customers not being part.
I've always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks than in those risks there is opportunities.
I think when you take the people out of that, it's pushing them into failure.
I think when you train your employees at risk at risk being preparing for all of their company to be <unk>
I feel that what it has to happen to move forward is we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, let's move forward, I think we need to give fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear <unk> the risk.
From a <unk> we need to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to stop transparency.
More than ever a little bit of honesty is going to go through a long way.
And I said that, with honesty and transparency, all my talk about: <unk> has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought rights from the name of <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> the <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So, <unk> on behalf of the transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a remarkable question.
In my pocket I have a check to name of the TED matrix, the <unk> Foundation, a check for <unk> to be applied to my TED assistance for the next year.
The idea behind the digital worm worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Its biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are systems control in real time.
If we managed to compromise these systems that are controlled and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software are from a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put an effective virus out of Windows in a laptop used by a portable computer to set up this gray box, then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
<unk> entered the gray box, damages the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we find this.
When we started researching <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing you knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of <unk> the <unk> using multiple vulnerabilities <unk>
It seemed like to do something with these <unk> boxes these control systems.
And so that struck us with it, and we started an experiment where we had our environment <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
And so they went very strange.
<unk> became <unk> as a lab rat that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
It didn't make sense for me.
And then to experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
<unk> is looking at the active box in the gray box if it finds a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect it is actually working on that place: working on that place: going.
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
Could it be, let's say for example, a plant of the United States, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than we would take the goal soon.
And so we pulled out and forth the attack, and we discovered that I was <unk> on two <unk> a small little and a big one.
We also saw that they were very professionally armed by people who obviously had all the internal information.
We would take all the points to attack.
You probably know how much the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell you, the payload is very complex.
It's very above all we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code source.
We're talking about 15 lines of code.
It's pretty old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking at initially was called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
And then we were looking for <unk> and data structures and tried to <unk> with the real world, with potential targets in the real world.
We need the theories about communities that we could pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a white <unk> and it's certainly located in Iran, because it's where most of the infections has been <unk>
There are no thousands of targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant and the plant of <unk> <unk>
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I went back to an effort for <unk> their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we could associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
The rotor it's that cell phone inside the <unk> that black object that you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they can certainly <unk> and even make the <unk> explode.
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an effort to <unk> the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to figure out the digital <unk> looking very closely at the data and their structures.
So, for example, the number <unk> stands up in that code, you can't afford it.
I started looking at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better enough.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called <unk>
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in our hands.
So it wasn't like this.
The results have been taken after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> in ends.
And yet, we discovered that both digital <unk> would look at one and same goal, but from different <unk>
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making <unk> and <unk> and <unk> it communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we have determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about the other goals being <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw -- really <unk>
There's the gray box, and the top you see the <unk>
What this thing does is intercept the values of the entrance entrance for example, from the pressure sensors and the vibration sensors and provides <unk> code, which is still running during attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these false entry data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds out of <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not only <unk> of the operators in the fourth of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital safety system.
We need digital safety systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a power plant, when the big steam turbine is happening, you need to open escape valves in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't do a human operator of it.
That's where we need digital safety systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can go through bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And neither are the <unk> and the security system is <unk>
That scares you.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
There's nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> of uranium.
Could it work too, for example, in a power plant, or in an automobile plant.
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this burden with a key <unk> as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology from worms to <unk>
It will be as much as possible.
And if you made that, with what you want, it's with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with big number of goals.
We have to deal with the implications, and better than we start making it now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has become public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What is your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, they really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is <unk>
The engine behind this is the hormone <unk>
There is one single one, and that's the United States, hopefully <unk>
Because, in another way, our problems would be larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
So I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and give it <unk> or other skills to make users from wheels and get up and come up and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
There are nothing different from something that you put in the morning, gives you a big force, which is also increasing its speed, and helps you for example, to drive the balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not just that -- it can integrate it and connect it to the universe and with other hopeful things.
This is not an amazing idea.
To show you now what we're working on, we started to talk about the American soldier who, on average, have to carry on your back a <unk> load of <unk> and it's getting <unk> to get even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some major complications in the back 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage to back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that I could help to manage the issue.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk>
Soldier: With the <unk> exoskeleton I can give you 90 pounds of variables for many hours.
Their flexible design allows you to get in <unk> <unk> and run with great <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then my resistance goes up and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back now to the users of chairs <unk> about what I feel particularly <unk>
There are <unk> million people on the wheels in the world on the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We're talking about something that happens often very young people with damage to the spinal cord that when they start their life -- 30 or 40 years -- collide up against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We are also talking about the population that is getting up very quickly.
Her only option, many times -- in a brain injury, or something else.
And this has been this for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years old, had an injury in the neocortical column, and as a result he couldn't walk back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors ...
It's completely not <unk> in crutches that send signals to the computer on board here on the back.
There are also a little bit of batteries that give the engines on the <unk> and on the knees, and they do it with this soft and very natural <unk>
I was about 24 years at the top of my life when, by a stranger jump in the air, moving down the bottom of it was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all motion from <unk> down.
Shortly after that, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> never you'll be <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole my way to the last few of the hope of my being.
<unk> technology since then, has been allowed me to learn to <unk> costs down the <unk> and climb rocks and even ride on a bicycle <unk>
But they've never invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just soldiers, but Amanda, and all the users of the wheelchair, to all of them.
AB: Thank you.
I've just come back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> they practice sex to say, hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where the fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival. Man <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet their cousins.
This is the world of wild Bonobos in rainforests of Congo.
The bonobos are along with chimpanzees, their closest living relatives closest alive.
That means we all share a common ancestor, a evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made a lot of emphasis on this aspect in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
While chimpanzees are dominated by big -- <unk> the society Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society where the deadly violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the forest -- and it's been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> an land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that has been prolonged for decades and caused nearly as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction also puts in danger the survival of the Bonobo.
<unk> meat and deforestation make you can't fill in no stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear the <unk> hidden in the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as apes -- the love of love, not <unk> because they have frequent sex, <unk> and <unk> to manage conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the existence of the Bonobo is more than <unk> <unk>
By <unk> like humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game game.
For us and the game is critical to establish ties and encourage <unk>
With him we learn <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game, Bonobo you see the <unk> roots of laughter and dance and <unk>
The game is the glue that came together.
I don't know what you play with, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I don't talk about football.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look what it is.
Could it be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk> <unk> <unk>
I just think that in this case, he loves him, right?
Yeah.
So sexual game is common so much on bonobos as in humans.
And this video really is interesting because <unk> this video really is interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into the game -- like the <unk> and also how play requires trust, and <unk> <unk> and at the same time it's more fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt many ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> perhaps the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is a young female -- a young female who's playing with a little bit of <unk>
I think, like her, sometimes we play alone, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of the understanding that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a world more and more difficult for greater and greater cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we need to play.
But let's go to the maximum of our ability of game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is critical.
For bonobos and humans, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at least appropriate to play, you can be the most urgent moments as <unk>
So, fellow primates, we accept this gift of evolution and play together as we teach creativity, your friendship and the wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for the development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I am not battling poverty, we'll build fires as a captain of a <unk> body volunteers.
And in our city, where volunteers <unk> a highly skilled staff, you have to get to the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability to go.
But there was still a race to the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what was our task.
When I found <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were in the middle night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in her pajamas and her house was on fire.
The other volunteer that had just arrived before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- he got first up to Captain and he asked him to go inside and save the dog <unk>
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or <unk> of money, which, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people that I entered a <unk> building to save a live live -- just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to go to the house.
I need you to <unk> <unk> and he brings this woman a couple of <unk>
I promise it <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I went on the stairs, at the end of the hall, went to the <unk> firemen who were going to that height and less had finished off the fire and went to the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my payload back on the staircase where I met my <unk> and the lovely dog at the front door.
<unk> from the house to your home owner where, as you would expect, their trove got much more attention than my own.
A few weeks later the department received a letter from the owner of the home house for the brave effort to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at everything else was that someone had reached a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> like in my calling as volunteer fireman -- I'm a acts of acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of happy acts and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So, when I look at this room to people who have achieved, or are you for -- remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you this: not wait.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, it will be right now.
<unk> food in a dining room, <unk> a park from the <unk>
I'm mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone else's life, but each day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So he trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a great fan of a particular block of concrete.
The first blocks of concrete they made in <unk> with a very simple idea of cement modules from a fixed measure that they fit together.
Very quickly, these became the most used unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things larger than us, as buildings or bridges, a brick at the time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, <unk> came up with this.
He was called <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, <unk> bricks came to every house.
It's estimated that they have made over 400 billion or 75 billion to every person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings, or houses.
It made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new block of construction.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a <unk> <unk> <unk> world on a world where everything was interactive.
Like the particular block of concrete, the transistor allows us to create much greater and more complex circuits at the same time.
But there's a <unk> difference -- the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't know that the building blocks of our time are reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing engineers into the hands of artists and designers.
I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> all these things are electronics each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best of everything is that they are interacting with magnets.
So you can't put it wrong.
<unk> have a code source.
The green is, the blue is the stream, the rose is the entrance and the orange is the orange and the orange is the wire.
So you only have to assemble a blue with a green one, and very quickly you can start to make higher circuits.
A blue one in the green produce light.
Can we put a button in the environment, and we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, that's here, and now we have a <unk> light.
It <unk> this <unk> to create more impact and have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, they're actually very powerful.
Instead of having to <unk> and connect and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple gestures, so on.
To make <unk> faster or slower -- just a button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a collection growing.
We want all the interactions in the world to <unk> to <unk> <unk>
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We have given to children to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light function, or why the door of an elevator is kept open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We also have led to design schools.
So, for example, designers without experience some electronics start playing with <unk> like a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>  A few weeks ago, we brought the designers from the Rhode School of Rhode Island who don't have any experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper and said, Make something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a <unk> barrel of motion.
But wait, here comes my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is afraid of the dark.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be in the grasp of everyone.
So <unk> has open source.
You can go on the website, you can download all of the design files and you get <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors because this world we live in, this interactive world is ours.
So ahead and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries today.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company seeks to get involved in the environment focusing on the environment.
<unk> <unk>
This is a little clip of what we do.
Let's take a minute.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue to get the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Solar technology is ...
Oh, I think of time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that's supposed to be <unk> we asked them to work in government.
The initiative called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like a <unk> of Peace <unk>
<unk> some members every year and put them working with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to the Third World we send the wild world to the wild.
They made great <unk> worked with employees <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of technology today.
Meet <unk>
It's a <unk> of the city of Boston.
Here it comes up as if I would look for a quote, but what you really find is that someone else is going to get it, when you get trapped by snow because he knows it's not very good by turning fires when he's covered by a meter of snow.
How did he come to ask for help in this very <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of <unk> members for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time I spent a lot of last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: that citizens went with shovels right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You embrace <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case, put it <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can be <unk>
I mean, it has a players' component.
It's a modest app.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 applications -- last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
It spreads in viral form.
A responsible for systems of <unk> City to see this application realized that he could use it, not for the snow, but for citizens to have a <unk> <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of the tsunami, but people are <unk>
So it asks the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just just turned it to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they were born.
So now we know nine cities that plan using it.
And this has been spread without <unk> in organic and natural fashion.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know this doesn't happen yet.
The acquisition of software usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for the parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us to have done for normal channels would have taken at least two and end about two million dollars.
And that's not anything.
Now there is a project in power court from California that until the moment has 10 billion dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this on every level of government.
So an app that has been program in a couple of days, and it spreads in viral form is a kind of shot shot to the institution of government.
It suggests to the world's best ways to work, not like in private companies, like a lot of people think that it should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather like the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> in open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this application is that it represents the way to address the question of government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution, but as a problem of collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out that we're very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools to work together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to <unk> apps every day in their own communities.
They haven't given up with the government.
They feel a great frustration before that, but they don't get <unk>
And these people know something we've lost from view.
And that is that if we get aside the feelings about politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that they set up with -- the government is basically in the words of Tim <unk> "What do we do together because alone don't <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
Politics is not <unk>
And because the government ultimately turns out -- remember that <unk> <unk> the way to think about it will affect the way that change change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, especially <unk>
This is the center of service telephone and information.
It's the place that hits the calls if you mark <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He joined the official knowledge.
I did not find any. It started using animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, put the music right now and see if they were <unk>
And it worked. So it worked.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has an app and mobile phone called <unk> <unk>
You don't want that application.
It was the work of very smart people from the Bureau of New York City <unk>
One day, this really happened this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do for <unk>
<unk> dynamics are different.
Scott was talking about person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is audience, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
And the next report, he said, "I came up to the place, I found the bucket of garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I went home. I went home.
Good nights, <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and physical things.
And it's also a great example of the income of the government to the distributed distributed distribution.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of the platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to engage and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but the government had a key role.
It connected to the two people.
And it could have connected with government services to be necessary and the neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative than the government services.
When one neighbor helps each other, they <unk> the communities.
If we call control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing that we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people understand it, but you think you're the input from the other.
That our input to the government system is the vote.
How many times have they chosen a leader <unk> Sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government will <unk> our values and shape our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That is because government is like an immense ocean and politics is the shallow <unk>
So underneath it is what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot <unk>
But it's that <unk> which is keeping us that that we funded as something that's operates on our against, that other thing, and in consequence we're losing power.
People think politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work that we will have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because it's where the real job of government.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
Have you <unk>
It's a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed <unk> report of <unk> pages in response to the order of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> about the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's <unk> activism
And for those of us who have gotten to the government, it's time to ask ourselves what world we want to leave with our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they have to face.
Do you really believe that we have to go to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't do without government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root function of government so that it can expand to the civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows it's not that hard to act <unk> just to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I am, to <unk> I'm a more generation that many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who's going to talk about who is going to talk to each other.
They can express your opinions at any channel at the same time and they do.
So when they face the government problem, they don't really care enough to do about their voices.
They're using their hands.
They bring their hands to the work to program applications that do better work for government.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> taking off <unk> dumping them into a trash cube that has a <unk> inside.
And of course, we were always able to have <unk> those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers -- we're not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't have the <unk>
So I want to ask everybody here, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, we will be a crowd of voices, or also we'll be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row.
I have spent most of my life in developing communities in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'm here at TED watching this stimulus and hearing this stimulus for me.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are said here are impact on the world.
In occasion, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have a different way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we have seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you teach them with feeling you can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I actually didn't learn this in the practice of law, my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of an African family -- dominated by a <unk> who was my grandmother.
It was hard it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in all discussion in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in Virginia about the <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way I saw the world.
She was hard but it was also <unk>
When I was little, I looked at it, and I was giving myself a good hug.
I was so hard I could barely breathe and then <unk> me.
One or two hours later, I would come back to <unk> and he said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I was saying no, I got back again and if I was saying yes, he left me in peace.
He had this human quality that I made you always wish to be close to her.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of the 10.
In occasion, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to take their time and pay attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight -- nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me.
At first I thought it was a game.
And then he looked at him and she was <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 -- 20 minutes, she stood up, went through the room, and he took me out of my hand, and he said, "Come on. I'll leave you <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say it to <unk>
I said, "It's okay, <unk>
She said, "Now let's say <unk> I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, he looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> "I think you're a <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
And then he said, "Just do I want you to get me up three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "Well, the first thing I want you to do, is you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that I always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> I'm going to do it."
Then he said to me, "I second thing I want to tell you, is that we're always going to do the right thing, although the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So I'll do it."
And then he finally said, "The third thing I want to do is I want to tell you that I was never <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> I'm going to do it."
I grew up in the field, in South Africa, I have a brother a older year and a younger sister.
When I was 14 to 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package of six <unk> I don't know where the <unk> took to my sister and me and we went to the forest.
We just got to do the <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he was offered to my sister, she took a little and volunteered to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right. You know, I'm going to do it, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> Today I think, and you always do the same thing as us.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What happens? Take a <unk>
And I got it up with force and <unk> "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that you probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this thinking it's a <unk> I say it for the power of identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that really don't make sense.
We can't get to do things that you don't think they can do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My whooping died of age-related disease?
And these were the things that, according to it, we need to <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different than what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In America, we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass incarceration in my view, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor and black communities, it finds so much <unk> so much despair, determined by these facts.
One out of every three black ones between 18 and 30 years is in jail or in parole.
In the urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all young people in color are in prison or in parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that comes to you much better if you're rich and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth that affects the results.
And it seems like we feel very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger and anger make us believe that these are not problems.
We're <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work -- some of the developments that are very curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you hate rights for always if you have a criminal all."
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of black male population has definitely lost the right to the vote.
And if we put it over the next 10 years, the level of loss of rights to be as high as it was before they had the law law to vote.
We have this astonishing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where it was sentence to <unk> to die in prison.
We have in this country prison for children, no possibility of getting ever.
Right now, we're in some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They were going to people in death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
And in a certain sense, you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death row in America is defined by mistake.
In every nine <unk> people have identified an innocent people who is innocent and liberated from the <unk> of death.
A mistake, <unk> an innocent rate of every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation wouldn't be allowed to never fly airplanes if every nine who <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my class with students about history <unk> I talk about slavery to you.
I talk about terrorism, the time it started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted to the Second World War.
We don't really know a lot about this.
But for American Americans in this country, it was a time defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried to be <unk>
The terror of terror was what they defined life.
Now there are people bigger people who come up to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you tell and make people say that in our history we deal to say that in our history we deal with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of race and racial separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
And all the time we're going to do with each other.
We are constantly tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that you couldn't overcome <unk> <unk> without a commitment to the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany at the death penalty <unk>
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood up after my presentation and said, "You know, it's pretty disturbing to listen to what you <unk>
<unk> "We have no death row in Germany.
We can never get it here."
The room was in silence and a lady said, "There is no way in our history, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, <unk> and <unk> were to <unk>
Let's get it into this.
How do we engage in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in their <unk>
We couldn't do it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these very difficult issues, the positive things and wonderful things are wonderful and yet <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology, <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
In my opinion, you need to integrate both things.
lately we've talked about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more commitment, more commitment, more engagement, of life of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> who never come to TED.
If you think about them is, in a way, something that's within our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen before.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, as committed to intellectual,
By innovation, with creativity. The development is not just brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas, also because of the <unk>
This connection of mind with heart is what drives us to look at not just the brilliant and <unk> but also in the dark and the difficult.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering, we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will for being in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There is no related disconnect with technology and design, which allowed us to really be human if we don't pay attention to poverty, to address inequality, injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignored these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer from meeting Rosa <unk>
These women were just together to talk about.
Occasionally, the lady <unk> was called me to say, <unk> comes the <unk>
Do you want to come and go away."
He said, "I do."
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I would tell you <unk>
And so I was going to just go back and just throw them up.
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Mrs. <unk> went to me and said, "Now, please tell me that this idea of <unk> justice.
<unk> what you're trying to do."
And I started giving my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question the injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed unfairly.
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in criminal justice administration.
We try to end up the sentences for life, without freedom <unk> for children.
We try to do something about death penalty death.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end up with the <unk> <unk>
I gave her all my best speech and he looked at me and he looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And he <unk> <unk> <unk>
At that time, Ms. <unk> <unk> me in the face and said, "It's why you have to be very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to address those challenges, those issues, that suffering.
Because finally, humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been <unk> on simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that each of us is higher to the worst than we've ever met.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a <unk>
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong, it's not that it's a <unk>
Even if somebody kills each other, it's not that it's a <unk>
This is why I think there's a basic dignity of people who should be held by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and, certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I believe that even though it's very beautiful, very beautiful, very <unk> not to judge us by our technology, by our designs, or our intellectual capacity or rational.
By the end of the end of a society, not the character of a society, not the way we treat rich, powerful and <unk> but by the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> <unk> like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my appeals in a very important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients at 13 and 14 years old, which have been <unk> so they were taught as adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone into whatever it is?
The judge would tell him as an adult, but I see a child.
One night, I was very late -- my God, if the judge can become something you don't say you should have magic powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magic powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was too late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> customer -- a small poor, white.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my black customer in 14 years to be treated as a white <unk> <unk> <unk> from a <unk>
In <unk> I found that there were been <unk> conduct in the <unk> in the police behavior and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how this country has no ethical -- but a lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> would be a dream, or really the <unk>
For my horror, not only had it sent to the court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh God, I have to go to the court for this case stupid.
I got up to the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
Finally came down to me from the car.
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with a black man who was <unk> he was <unk>
When she saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who's you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he said, "It's you. I said yes.
And then I got bored and <unk>
And I was interested in the ear,
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the audiences.
When I walked in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk> And we started going.
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those crazy things.
They got the policemen the prosecutors <unk>
Suddenly without knowing how, the room was full of people -- all because they were talking about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the eye <unk> I was going to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I would just look down the window, and let all of that <unk>
I kept walking over here and over there.
Finally, this old black <unk> in the room and sat behind the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge would have a <unk>
During the break a <unk> <unk> he showed himself upset because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant passed on the old black ones.
And he said, "You know, what do you do in the operating room.
And the old black stood up, looked at me and he looked at me and he said, "Let's go to this <unk> room to tell this young woman to keep her view on the goal with <unk>
I have come to TED today because I think many of you realize that the moral arc of the universe is very large, but it folds towards justice.
We cannot be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
Our survival is attached to each other.
That our visions of technology, design and entertainment and creativity must lead to <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of you who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view on the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire in the audience, of this community, to help in your purposes of doing something.
That's not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities nearby.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which is going to be an effort to give you the funding that you spend today in science policies today.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death penalty in the next five years.
And despite this, the <unk> of the cases of homicide is not <unk> in <unk>
<unk> of rapes don't get nowhere.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to come up to propose that these funds are going to be able to make the law <unk>
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There have been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it's said that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to those who believe this is?
<unk> In fact, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's because of the wrong war.
This is why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes of legal causes to bring people to chain -- to steal a bicycle, a little bit of crimes against the property, rather than making those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing do for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> You've been excited to be excited about here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months, <unk> could be for the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that media means <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention to.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day our senses are getting more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing matters to us to survive, the first stop of all of that data is an old clip of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector, the <unk>
<unk> and records all the information for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So that of a <unk> of stories, to look at the negative.
That old saying of <unk> "If there is blood <unk> it's very true.
And because all of these digital devices give us a negative news -- the seven days of week, 24 hours a day, no wonder that we're <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going wrong with worse.
But maybe it won't.
Maybe instead, what happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps huge progress done in the last century for a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good issues -- climate change, the <unk> of species, the shortage of water and <unk> we have no doubts them.
As human beings, we are very good at <unk> the problems and the long -- we've just got with them.
<unk> then happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average life has been more than <unk> average income per capita per capita by inflation has been <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has dropped down 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, of the electricity, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve Pinker showed us that we are living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that the global literacy has gone from 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're actually living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we continue to get higher and higher expectations.
In fact, we redefined the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, much of the people living under the poverty line have electricity, water, <unk> <unk> television, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> the <unk> the planet would never have dreamed of such <unk>
And so a lot of this is technology and so on, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that we can put into information technology jumps into this curve, Moore's Law and double the price of price in about 12 to 24 months.
That's why the mobile phone you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad time, in war and peace, in recession.
It's the end of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop before any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law on the left, it goes up.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And on this curve, it comes from Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have.
The computation in the cloud, which my friends in <unk> call infinite computing and networks, and its ability to democratize <unk> and its ability to democratize <unk> all over the planet, synthetic biology, fuels and food and food, digital medicine, digital medicine, <unk> and <unk>
I mean, how many saw the victory at "Jeopardy" <unk> "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked for the newspapers the best headline than <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
Play with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, which is available for all on the phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have been absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create life -- for every <unk> is about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking that that it's scarce and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk> story.
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
<unk> troops were <unk> of silver, and the same <unk> with covered with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
That's why the tip of the <unk> to Washington is aluminum.
You see, although aluminum is the mass of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as a <unk>
It's tied for oxygen and <unk>
But then he came up with it, and he made the aluminum and made it so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
It was <unk> this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet that is now by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about treatment, but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that in the late decade, in the <unk> parts of the United States, the solar electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents of the national average.
And if we have an abundance of energy, we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about the wars around the water.
Remember when Carl Sagan pointed at the Voyager 1 towards the Earth, in 1990, after I spent <unk>
<unk> a famous picture -- how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, the two percent is water, and we fought by the <unk> of the planet, but there is also a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators of the <unk> I'd like to share with you, he gave me permission to <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> -- it's the size of a small refrigerator size.
It's able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water to the day of any source -- saltwater, water <unk> by less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola has just learned that I'm going to do a major proof of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence that this will be, Coca-Cola is going to be able to implement the world in <unk> countries.
This is an ongoing innovation by this technology that today exists.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
Oh my God, we're going to reach 70 percent of the mobile phones in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that Lakota warrior has better mobile mobile communications in Kenya that President Reagan did 25 years ago.
And with a smart phone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted before.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video <unk> video images -- <unk> images of music and music, <unk> diagnostic technology now <unk> and they lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe I get the best to get to the health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which was something called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're challenging the teams of the world to make these technologies in a mobile device with the one that you talk about, and because it has <unk> you can <unk> you can be able to be able to be able to be extracted blood from the finger.
To win it has to make better diagnoses than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the <unk> load is 25 percent of the health workers and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this device <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that doesn't allow us to call the health and the first place, avoiding the pandemic.
But this is the greatest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just will spend the brand of the seven billion billion.
By the way, the best protection against demographic explosion is to give to the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it'll go from two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion of our minds ever before <unk> that you add to the global conversation.
What do these people?
What do you do? What do you want?
And instead of economic collapse we will have the greatest economic injection in history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of using 3D impressions and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we provide three billion more members of humanity, healthy educated and <unk>
How about some voices never before <unk>
What if we give them to the oppressed. everywhere they are, a voice to be <unk> and could act for the first time?
What are these 3,000 billion?
And if they are contributions that we can't afford to.
One of the things that I learned with the X X is that teams were small, guided by their passion with a goal of course, they can do things that were before they could only do big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you heard of.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
The folds determine the structure and the <unk>
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem with <unk>
They've played with this college professors, in each other.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined and started <unk>
And it has been shown that today, the machinery of human patterns is better folding proteins than best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the innovative passion of <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that will be taught to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have in front of some extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
The <unk> of the point of <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before you give them three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
They probably believed that I <unk> but it wasn't like this.
It's actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it very much until the decade of <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red List of the <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special to do.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures still say they keep <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, a few mangroves.
There were <unk> from about 20 <unk> the black beard <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so it was made over the middle of the middle in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the number of fish had dropped down in half.
I went down to the five centimeters high.
They would make a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> it started in <unk> Europe conducted a lot of development projects.
<unk> development was supposed to impose up countries that were already 100,000 <unk> <unk> the industrial fishing.
And this boat, quite <unk> was called the <unk> four.
I went to fish in it, and we did studies in the South Sea Sea Sea <unk> and, above all, in the Beaufort Sea.
What we capture was something <unk>
<unk> now the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny about <unk> remains that are fish on coral reef.
In short, the sea sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then the commercial fishery begins.
The background is going to be a very solid coral fund in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Don't <unk> The <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
And then they wanted to look at it, because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen are collected every time they go to an area where they've never fish.
But you don't have <unk>
<unk> the world, but we don't remember it.
<unk> the point to start to start to start the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you go through this something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, many <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use images to use the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive loss that happened before.
You can analyze the accumulation of changes.
And at the end of the end, keeping some <unk> remains.
And that, in great point, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies die, they kill animals without knowing what they've done until about generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very plentiful, before it was <unk> it's <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focused on the big animals, and in a <unk> sea of big fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
Over time there are few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know that it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they'll do it because the evidence presented in an earlier way, is not the way they would expect that it has evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of the present, as the captain just like captain just looked at a lot of fish in this area that can be used or generally they don't use the scientists in the fish, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies, because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
And there the enormous role that can be able to make a marine marine area.
Because with the marine areas of the protected areas, we actually also recreated the past.
So let's look at the past that people can't conceive because the starting point has been running and is extremely low.
That's for people who can see a marine protected zone, and they can benefit from the vision that they <unk> which allows them to erase their point.
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access, like people in the Middle West, for example?
I think there and the arts and cinema may fill in the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of <unk> Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in <unk> Bay.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why do we <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one that giving, is to <unk> <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> manager and I look at YouTube video.
It's true.
And so today we will see why the videos are being done in the viral and how important it is.
We all want to be <unk> I <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed something very, very difficult.
But today the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper in a part of our global culture.
Any one can be done on the Internet in a <unk>
It goes over 48 hours of video to YouTube per minute.
And in those, only one small percentage is viral goes together and makes cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of philosophy.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this filmed video outside of his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the views in the rise of last summer.
<unk> was not saying to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double <unk>
That's what you do if it's called Mountain <unk>
I had already published a lot of videos from nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that <unk> the video <unk>
The trends of trends like Jimmy <unk> presented with new and interesting things and <unk> to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, it's Friday, on Friday.   Everybody wants me to come up on a Friday.   Everybody wants me to get the end of the week, the weekend.  KA: Wouldn't you think we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have come out of nowhere.
So what did this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they're also a Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday, <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> from <unk> Science <unk> <unk> was one of the first people to make a joke on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of trends take a point of view and share it with a more broad audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who share this great joke in the inner joke then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike <unk> entertainment of the 20th century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a repetitive animation with a <unk> music.
So that's it.
This year you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's weird, you know that there is a three hours that has seen four million times.
So even the cats saw this video.
And there are cats who saw other cats see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that aroused between the Internet of the Internet.
There was <unk>
Somebody made an old version of the old one.
And then it was created.
And all of a sudden, there was a whole community of <unk> that made this happen from being a dumb joke to something that we all can form a part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who might have predicted <unk> <unk> or RS: <unk> or <unk> <unk>
What the script might have been written by this situation?
In a world where two days of video that you go up two days of video by minute, just that really unique and unexpected can be able to make it <unk> so that these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who protest against <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit I didn't really interested in too much.
Casey Casey <unk> I <unk> <unk> by <unk> but often there are obstacles that prevent you circular from the <unk>
KA: Thanks to the surprise that and his humor, Casey Casey was able to get five million to see and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth the whole new thing we do in a creative way.
And all of this leads to a big <unk>
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> communities of participation, totally unexpected, are features of a new kind of media -- a new kind of media -- where we all have access and is the audience that defines the popularity of it.
As I said earlier, one of the current <unk> Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
They won't be permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media characteristics -- it's just about the current media -- but we need the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported by the only unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> while <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so long friends, <unk>
They <unk> in silence.
He died broken in the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that be in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to be <unk> but I would do it.
The next part of the puzzle is on a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> towards the sea.
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two little girls.
For her, life had been destined for a <unk> task for his family and a new life in Australia.
It was inconceivable for her that I couldn't do that.
And after a <unk> of four years that challenges the fiction, a boat slid into the sea <unk> sea ship.
All the adults knew risks.
The greatest fear were the <unk> the rape and the death.
Like most of the adults, my mother was wearing a <unk>
If we first took it out, we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the engine, <unk> diving into every wave, and the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men on our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start by six hours.
But I do remember the lights on the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, and he was just too much to get it; and the first apple that I tried to put up with the men on the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, they would be <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women across three generations making a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> suburb whose population is <unk>
Unlike the middle class suburbs whose existence was <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the English fragments of English <unk> among people who had one thing in common: They were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a car assembly line, working six days, <unk> turn.
Yet I found time to study English and get a bachelors degree at IT <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and they established an extra comment on English and mathematics, you wouldn't mind what was supposed to be <unk> which was usually <unk> it was always a second hand.
Two pairs of half a school, one to <unk> holes in the other.
A school uniform until the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> back again.
At home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were <unk> on our day and we were hearing our grandmother's movements at the house.
My mother was suffering from the ship.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares started to be able to be able to make them.
She opened a computer shop and then studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And women would come with their stories about men who couldn't make the <unk> angry and <unk> and <unk> boys were trapped between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they were created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic classical student with what I was talking about myself.
On the other hand, I was <unk> <unk> tragically <unk> by violence, drug abuse and <unk>
But many got help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of teacher, I was elected by the American Australian <unk>
And I was <unk> of a piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges of not <unk>
As <unk> a resident anonymously <unk> was now so <unk> refugee and social activist invited to talk about sites that I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence would have ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat to the clinic and the comfort of life in a <unk> suburb -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending up the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each one and running <unk> three in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when she got to the ship.
It had ever been an option.
He said, "You know, you don't know what you don't know.
So I talked about <unk> juvenile and education and <unk> the <unk> and the <unk>
And the more frankly I talked about, the more I was to talk about it to talk.
I met people from all of the roads in life, many of them doing what we were living on the border of the possible.
And although I ended up my job, I realized I couldn't stay in a law race.
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a <unk> new thing on the scene -- and not just it's good, but it's something that will be grateful, perhaps a gift of the ship.
Because being inside can easily mean <unk> the <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave them enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was an energy there, an optimism -- a blend of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
<unk> a small group of people who were able to can't afford it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a dime.
At the end of every day, it was made a giant pot on the soup that everybody <unk>
They went down to the entrance to the entrance to the time.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some bright ideas and we opened up step.
It made the decision to move to the U.S.
After a just journey.
My hunch again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before I end up, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared for.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 became a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of her husband, he had an stir to <unk> and take the cause and a lot more <unk> caused when I won.
It can't be done to be wrong.
I was in the shower in a hotel room in <unk> when she was killed, to 1,000 kilometers, in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw him stop the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around his <unk>
We tell the stories and we made sure that we were still with it.
On the night a monk came and told us that he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to hold their hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken his hand from the <unk> he said.
"You haven't <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since those of us who were and how life we <unk> we can now see that the men that had reached our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat had easily <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who might want that to know?
However, I'm afraid of the privilege of the easy of the right.
Can I give you a <unk> in your lives, a brave <unk> in every wave, the constant pace of the motor, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and look at it, I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of <unk> today in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky, with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the age of the former Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
So at that time when we <unk> the big prince warrior Indian warrior -- he pulled out a bow and with a <unk> on the ground, I was able to get water.
We now do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we launched was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that struck me a lot.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I had this idea of losing the ability to enjoy the ability of enjoying and appreciating a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't afford my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow magic, not kill her.
And my grandfather gave me his father's silver <unk>
And this piece of <unk> <unk> was for my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images of images, of <unk> and <unk> in my imagination.
And I had a sense that mobile phone, the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent them to go.
We put our inspiration.
And so I was <unk> to this technology world to see how it can use to create magic, rather than killing her.
I was born books since 16 years old.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a storytelling device that can connect the readers of the entire world.
You can know how to take the book.
Where are we are.
You put the text with the image, the animation, the sound and the touch.
<unk> becomes increasingly <unk>
But what does that make us?
I'm about to launch an interactive application for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so ...  He says, "This box belongs to it. I write my name.
And so I become a character of the book.
At a number of times it comes to me -- the iPad knows where I live through the GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner girl are excited about all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but to that magic magic to those ideas that I <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always <unk>
So over here, we have to change the iPad to release the fireflies.
And actually, they light your way into what the book <unk>
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole nation in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world turns into a <unk> that I <unk> towards this magical device within the device.
And this opens a map.
In every book of fantasy there have always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that's growing, <unk> and guides you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another very important aspect for me is to create Indian content, and in contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and the <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra over millennia, in an old <unk> book.
That's why we're bringing them back into a children's history of it.
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that kids have been <unk> attached to their <unk> not to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our kids into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure that we have to go out on the outside, take the camera or iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to reclaim this childhood ritual we have to go out and on a chapter, and you would take a picture to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So it creates a digital collection of pictures that you can put on the Web.
A boy in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
And within the variants of connection between magic, Earth and technology are many possibilities.
And in the next book we asked to have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video turned and through and through and through an augmented reality that sees a group of cartoons that appear on the inside plants in the house.
And at a moment, the screen is filled with leaves here.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature will be correlated with technology and magic and technology is reaching one to another.
It <unk> the power of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves into the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that we felt through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things that we did at the University <unk> was <unk> to a listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she lifted up a little coffee cup or you and asked patients, family and <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of all, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> fail to stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's a very simple thing.
It has a doorknob on and down up.
Every morning I was shocked.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put the challenge to get to 95 <unk>
But it's so simple that every time I was <unk> sends my data to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is not at the same time that I need care assistance or some urgency of that style -- but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
As some of you know, I have over 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before I get to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure that are used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together to develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From next week to be available to be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And the people who are <unk> from their houses, to take their blood pressure, they will take their health pressure, to share it with each other, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where the patients assume a position, they come back to regain the control and to be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us health care because of the challenges we face, as the firing of the costs of one-on-one care, the <unk> of demand and other issues.
So these techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like this, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did, I'd like to share it with you with a video.
We all have controls of navigation on the <unk>
Maybe we even have them on our phones.
We know perfectly where <unk> ATMs in <unk>
And also where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food chains.
But where is the <unk> closest to help this patient?
We asked but nobody <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives at this moment.
What we did was we do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please say, <unk> where, and when it's open, because sometimes they open up in the office <unk> and you're closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we did an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody <unk> you can use their iPhone, and then the weeks will use their phone phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I would like to present this one, not just as a <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we want to make it globally.
We're <unk> all the colleagues in the world, at other universities, so that we will help us find and act as a center for the <unk> of <unk> all over the world.
Every time you're on vacation and somebody <unk> it can be a relative or someone in front of you, can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us verify these <unk>
You might be <unk> or <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> which shows is still in their place.
Please <unk> on this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take on their cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
I mixed with my earlier passion by drawing but it was a little bit different because when I use the camera the process was on planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when the <unk> <unk>
For me photography I had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
I thought anybody could do it.
And so I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by press the <unk>
<unk> like this is a building on a very <unk> road.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And, despite that, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful again, but with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say <unk> I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that can be <unk> but I always want to look like it looks like to have been captured in a way like photography.
<unk> where you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that will capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them seem real?
Are you the details or the <unk>
Do you get light?
What do you create the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is a perspective.
But at the end of the end, it's the way we interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is a <unk>
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here are three perfectly important objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined, it can create something that still seems to be <unk> as if it existed.
But, at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's move into the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't make any sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really different <unk>
And the things that make a picture of them seem to be realistic I think it's those in which we don't even know the things that are around us in our daily lives.
But when we combine photographs it's very important to be <unk> because in another way it is wrong.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the pictures combined must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet with these <unk> were taken into the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the principle and end of the different images with a perfect fight.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think that this is a picture of a landscape and the lower part is <unk>
But this image is totally composed of photographs of different places.
The personal thing I think is easier to create a place that it will find out because you don't need to put the ideas on your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought of this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to convince them to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on an fishing.
The shores are in a different location.
The <unk> was captured in a rock.
And yes, I even made the red house the top of the island to look more <unk>
So to get a realistic result I think it takes to do a good deal.
You always start with a sketch, an idea.
Then we have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful, and the very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
Let me start showing you a slide of technology, very boring.
Please, if you can <unk>
It's a diagram anybody took out of a folder mine.
I'm not very interested in showing you the details but the general aspect of it.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of microprocessors versus the power of local area networks.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as a lot of other people that we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on a logarithmic scale.
In other words, each step of here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
And I'm going to talk about technology with curves, it's something new.
Here's something strange.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn off the lights.
I put more intensity because you write about paper.
Why do you bring technological curves on some scales.
The answer is that if you draw them into a normal curve where, say, these are the years or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I would like to show you -- the diagram would look ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you want to take some other technology, like transportation, it on a <unk> curve.
But if something happens like this, it gives a change for change.
If the technology of <unk> <unk> as fast as we could take a cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But we don't go through that rhythm.
There is no precedent in the history of technological development of economic growth, that every few years orders of magnitude.
The question that I want to make is -- looking at these <unk> curves we see that they don't have forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
And we would take one of two things.
Or you're going to be turning into a typical curve, I know how something completely different, or maybe it will do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So we would now be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, to a new form.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask myself, "Is that the new way that you take the world?
Why should the world move the world?
The transition looks very, very confusing, if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what happened in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future is <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is going on.
We can feel a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't make a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different that understands what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition from <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and looking at things in the long term.
The scale of time that I would like to do that is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we looked at it every billion years.
And so you go back about two billion years when the Earth was a great dry rock with a lot of chemicals that are going around it.
If we look at the way that these chemicals were organized, we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin with RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this -- and that is that, at that time, there were <unk> oil <unk> with all sorts of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those oil droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that made them make materials from the outside and so the drops grew up.
And they began to split.
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms -- those <unk> of oil.
But those droplets were not alive in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random prescription of chemicals.
And every time they <unk> it <unk> a chemical distribution of the chemicals that we have.
So every <unk> it was a little different.
In fact, the droplets that somehow became better at the time of bringing the chemical <unk> <unk> more chemicals and <unk> more.
Mostly, they lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, and it was very simple, but things are interesting as interesting when these <unk> learned the trick of the <unk>
In some ways we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the prescription of the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution without meaning, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were to be able to do it.
The amazing thing is that that system of writing seems to have remained stable since that evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that kind of writing system.
In fact, every living being is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white powder that I try to hide security security.
But <unk> Tom this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data into this piece of DNA and <unk> 10 at the age of 22,
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and you would have spread it over the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing the DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells be happy about another billion years.
But then it happened another great step in which things were very interesting in which things were very different in which these cells started exchanging and communicating information into the cells that cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, for example, we evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and <unk> them to create their little DNA with other bacteria, and now there are lots of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to the communities that, in a way, they were together in it, and established a <unk>
That <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals of that community to become more and <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came up when these communities came so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the whole recipe for the community together in a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities -- communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell is no longer without the heart, or the muscles of the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and they produced more interesting levels than cell phone, something that we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that didn't make it more than processing information in the community.
They're neural structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those cell phones built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and conveying information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So a organism, for example, learn not to eat some fruit because he knew evil and sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because before they had built these information processing structures that would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit processing.
So the fact that the nervous system is that those structures of information really accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time you need to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So, for example, the most <unk> version of course, is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
And I have a very complicated idea of a <unk> idea.
I'm sitting here emitting a couple of <unk> and hopefully building a sort of similar idea, vague and <unk> in his heads that saves some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated that we turned it into sound, in sound sequences.
That now allows us to start working as a organism.
In fact, like humanity, we've started to perform abstractions.
Now we go through periods of similar periods to the organisms that are <unk> our <unk> methods and information processing information.
For example, the invention of language was a small step in that direction.
The <unk> the computer tape, the video tape, and so are the specialized mechanisms that we now built to manage that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in <unk>
You already saw the evolutionary <unk> evolutionary <unk> where we had some evolution with the <unk> program before our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scales of time again.
The first stages of the story that I told you took billion years every one.
The next few stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The following, the language and so on, took less than a million years.
And around, like electronics, it seems to be just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that speeds up its own pace of change.
The more changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I earn the life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that jobs for <unk> would not be possible without any possible computer advances.
But now design objects such as complexity that would be impossible for me to fit in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor in that process of connections.
There are thousands of millions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think about a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine and the machine with that makes it something that before I did not do it, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes it uses methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method I've been using <unk> is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the <unk>
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million instructions to chance?
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, running all of those programs, and take those that more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we find the programs that are more close to <unk>
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did it.
But once I could find two numbers on the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences.
Let's get those and <unk> the rest.
And now we would say the best <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to the <unk>
Let's take two programs, which <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and that the children will pick up the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs that are made from programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please repeat <unk>
Let's go back again.
We would bring some mutations into it.
And it tries new and <unk> with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in terms of complicated, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that were <unk> numbers absolutely perfect.
In fact, they are much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs, I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to analyze them to see how they work.
They're dark programs, strangers.
But they have <unk>
In fact, I know that, I have the security that they get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that did it.
In fact, their lives depended on it.
Once he was in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he gets a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> that work together to offer a <unk> flight doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they're <unk>
So we started to depend on computers to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal works.
But we don't understand all the choices that you have.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
We now use those programs to make computers much faster and so able to run these programs much faster.
I mean, it is <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it looks so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we're at a moment analog to the <unk> organisms, when they became <unk>
We are <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant in our part to think that we're the end product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of what it is.
But now it comes lunch and I think I'll stop here before I get away.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that must change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time to let me give up some of my fake <unk> on that.
Before I was dealing with the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit of baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's going to be <unk> the <unk> talks about statistics and use them to form a great baseball.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope that many of you know.
It's called the average <unk>
And we talked about a <unk> that we <unk> 300.
That means that <unk> bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the game field without <unk> and anyone who tried to launch it at the first base -- not to get to time, and the second foundation will be <unk>
three <unk> <unk>
You know how they call a <unk> <unk> in the Big <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of the stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone 10 <unk> <unk> four.
<unk> like the legendary Williams, the last player from the League <unk> <unk> in running more 400 strokes in a regular season.
Now I will take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less awkward, after what I'm telling you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they're <unk> to a surgeon who has also a record on <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a place and a wanted to have two arteries <unk> <unk> and his family doctor is derived to a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is 200 of them.
But you know what?
She's a remarkably good job.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I will ask you.
What do you think that it must be the average hits of a heart surgeon, or a nurse from a nurse or a nurse <unk>
Six.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in the medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or a <unk>
What we do, though, is sending them to the world, and I include the mandate to be perfect.
That never, would never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that I <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> student <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman
<unk>
<unk> in my little <unk> the nurses at the General General in Toronto, and not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my class of <unk> <unk> the origin and the muscle work, the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the diagnosis of nature, and not standard.
And even I knew the diagnostic diagnosis of how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more knowledge and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated from <unk>
And I went from the school of medicine with the impression that if you were going to take everything, then you would know everything, or the most possible, close to everything, because I get away from mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the <unk> <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought the lady to the emergency service of the emergency service where I worked out.
At the time I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when I applied to a cardiologist I was going to go to this patient.
I would report to the head of residents.
When I saw the lady, I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when I heard it, I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which would give me a <unk> heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and, instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes into our lungs, these are blood cells, and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I was going to.
I gave X-rays, and medication to alleviate the pressure in your heart.
I gave him <unk> water pills so that it could eliminate liquid <unk>
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes actually.
I sent her home without talking to the head of residents.
I didn't get up the phone and I did what I should have done, that I was calling my boss and <unk> with him so that he was going to go.
And if my boss would have seen, I would have been able to bring information into it.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that will be constant care.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take care of <unk> that I could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When they send her home, I didn't really pay attention to a voice in my inner voice that was saying, <unk> isn't a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so sure that until I asked the nurse who was taking care of the <unk> <unk> <unk> who is okay if he goes to his <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said, "Yes, I think I'm okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
And so he signed the tall, the ambulance next with the <unk> brought her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach,
But I kept on my job.
At the end of the day, I would start to leave the hospital and I walked into the parking lot where my car was going to go home. So at that point, I did something I don't do normally, I don't normally do normally, I do something I don't normally do normally, at that point.
I went through the emergency emergency service service.
And there is another nurse, not that I was talking about the <unk> lady before, but another one told me about three words, those three words that most emergency physicians in emergency emergency.
Other specialists are afraid as well, but there is a <unk> in <unk> and we see the patients <unk>
The three words are: you remember that?
"It remembers the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And "Well, she <unk> the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
By the time of an hour of having come to her house, after I gave him the tall, he suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the emergency room with a blood pressure of 50 millimeters of <unk> which means a blind shock means.
Just breathe and was blue.
The emergency room <unk> all their resources.
They gave her medication to raise your blood pressure.
They had an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> until the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive therapy and waiting for all hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days, it was clear that we never met.
He had a permanent brain damage.
The family got together.
And at eight or nine days, they were going to get into what was happening.
And in the ninth day, he left her to go. The lady <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The next few weeks ago, I was given to it for that, and I experienced this for the first time <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture and sat alone, isolated <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't deal with your colleagues.
You make peace and it never makes that mistake.
It's that shame that it leaves teaching.
The embarrassment of which I'm talking about is that it makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that felt it.
And it wasn't by my <unk> he was <unk>
I talked to the family and I am sure that I would take things out and made sure that I didn't give up.
And I kept turning those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why would he sent her home?
And in my worst <unk> why did I made a mistake so <unk>
Why did I choose <unk>
Little to that feeling was <unk>
And I began to feel better.
And in one day, he was opened up the sky and finally came out the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with myself in the case that if I would bring the efforts to be perfect for not to make more errors, I would make those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it came back to happen.
Two years later, I was an <unk> in the emergency department in a community hospital in the north of Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I watched her throat, I was a little bit <unk>
He sent him out of penicillin and sent him home.
But as he ran to the door, he was still pointing out his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my guard, my boss asked me to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And he made three words: <unk>
<unk> the patient who saw by a pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but the upper airline goes down, and that can be the close side of those tracks.
He said, fortunately, not <unk>
They were going to get antibiotics through it -- and it will be recovered for the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> and then I went back to work, until it happened again and again and again and again.
Two times at the same turn of the <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, already to be transferred to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> <unk>
We had an X-ray of kidneys but it was normal. A colleague who was checking the patient <unk> a certain sensitivity in the lower right-hand quadrant, and he called a surgeon.
The other patient was very much diarrhea.
I had a liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague who would do it.
I looked at it and to notice some sensitivity in the lower quadrant, right in the surgeon.
Both were operated and they recovered well.
But every single case I was passionate about me.
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful ones have been for the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't stand up and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> to tell me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I teach you this to make the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this, I wouldn't have any idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course you will hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you won't hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- believe it would have difficulty looking at the eyes.
This is the system we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> which are actually making mistakes and the ones that I will not sleep and the ones that I know -- those who have <unk> outcomes and those who have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you take care of medicine to people who make mistakes.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism, I've done a personal study of poor medical litigation and medical failures to learn how possible, from the first article that I wrote for the Star Trek to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk> white art <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where the mistakes are happening every single day, where one in 10 drugs is wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where hospital-acquired infections are increasingly <unk> and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die of 24 <unk> by medical mistakes.
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so what things are.
A self-organizing system where knowledge is added every two to three years, and we don't have a <unk>
sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow to make a perfect history of a patient with pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain, comes up with <unk> eyes, and he went to alcohol and suddenly my story <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things as well.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't get their symptoms in the same way.
So the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we get rid of us, and we eliminate all the professionals likely to error, you don't have no one.
And with respect to that people don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white art, it's already a custom saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would tell everybody, from the ambulance up to the head of surgery to the head of surgery, <unk> "This is my worst <unk> blah blah blah blah blah blah. "What are your <unk>
And their students were <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> saliva and started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a medical medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The doctor <unk> is human, you accept it, and it doesn't proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They will save their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with intention of <unk> but in a loving way and support for everybody <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm human, they give errors mistakes.
And I feel a lot about it, but I am able to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what they think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a <unk>
Do you know how much we choose a week?
And I recently made a survey to over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that says to choose a half a half a half a day.
It doesn't do much, in a research week to a group of CEOs of companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks of these executives and the time they are making decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs a week.
Naturally, every job included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of your time.
Now think about their choices.
Do you know how many of them belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of the <unk>
How do we figure out how to deal with those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choosing to the overload of choices.
I want to talk about the problem and about possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know their answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
In another way, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, are ready to hear about the problem of the overload of <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this very, very <unk> level at least in that time was very sophisticated.
His name was <unk>
It was almost like going to an amusement park.
There were 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of the water <unk> and this was when we take water from the <unk>
I loved going to that shop, but on one occasion, I asked myself, why never buy anything?
This is the <unk> oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> <unk> that came from trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and I asked him, "Do you do well this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed out the buses full of tourists that came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
<unk>
They had different kinds of classes.
<unk> a post for <unk> just to the entrance store.
We put out there from six <unk> or 24 different flavors and we looked at two things: First, what if people were willing to stop trying to test the <unk>
More people stopped when there was a <unk> that when there was only six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a <unk>
Here we find the opposite effect.
Of those who stopped when there were only three percent she got to buy <unk>
Where you stood when there were six six, we saw that 30 percent.
If we do the calculations, people were six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, to decide that we don't buy <unk> we probably <unk> <unk> less is good for conserving <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the overload of options is affecting us in <unk>
We decided to not decide, even when this doesn't help us.
Now the theme of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see the decisions about retirement for retirement of about a million Americans, between 650 plans in this country.
We were interested in seeing whether the number of funds of funds available to savings plans for retirement, the program -- <unk> people to save for the future.
And we found that I really had a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, to 59 different options.
What we found is that the bigger the numbers were <unk> there were less participation.
So if we look at the extreme ends, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that offered about 60 to the rate of involvement across the 50th 1960s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there's more choices, even in that case, there is negative consequences.
So, for those who decided to participate, as much as the number of choices, more people are being trained to avoid actions or hedge funds.
As soon as there were more options, they were more willing to invest in financial <unk>
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we have to optimize to optimize our future financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we've seen three main negative consequences by providing more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that they are going to make the decision that we get it, even when it goes against their own interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things less <unk> even though they want to leave them better.
The main reason is that we <unk> with looking at that giant array of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for <unk> contrast and choice of that amazing <unk>
Today I want to <unk> four simple techniques that we have sort of <unk> in a way or another, in different research, so that they can test in their business.
The first one is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, which is less than now.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in <unk>
But actually what we're seeing is that if you decide to cut, you get rid of getting rid of you -- strange <unk> there will be a <unk> increase, there will be a <unk> increase in the costs, we'll have a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the corporation <unk> <unk> I eliminated the products to waste the cats that are less <unk> increased <unk> by two higher sales and lower cost.
You know that according to today, on average, offer 45,000 products.
In a Walmart store there are about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the current world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato tomato sauce.
In the financial savings world, I think that one of the best examples that have come out about how to manage the choices to manage the choices for David <unk> the Harvard.
All Harvard employees are automatically <unk> to a safe fund of life.
The people who really want to choose, are offered 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know, people often say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of these are options of them.
The first thing I do is ask <unk> <unk> the differences that are among those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, they can't do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that I would be willing to offer people in this audience a few paid <unk> to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to <unk>
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to take one applause if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> applause) OK. Anybody who's ready to accept the deal.
They are not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that journey?
I think I really would hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information on the first round, which in the second one, but I can tell you what they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images were making it more real.
This brings me to the second technique to manage the problem of the overload of choice which is <unk>
So for people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of every option, and that the consequences must be feeling very much very highly <unk>
Why do people spend 15 percent of 30 percent more on average, when they use credit card or credit cards than when they use it yet.
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more <unk>
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
In that meeting that we would look at exactly how we <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we added was that I would give the staff to think about the positive things that you would spend in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the amount they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> accounts for <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than choices.
For example, this is a study that we did in a friend's hallway,
We saw that in the retail supermarkets throughout the corridor of the <unk> the magazine exhibition can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because the ranking tells me how to <unk>
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk> applause) Well, there's some of them.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> but you know something?
This scheme of <unk> is totally useless.
The categories should tell you something that you might expect, not as the <unk>
You can often see this problem with these massive fundraising.
What are I supposed to do is who are <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can manage a lot more information than what we think about if you just give them a little bit.
We have to increase complexity complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
So let's look at a good decision -- the purchase of a car.
This is a German German manufacturer that allows you completely completely.
You have to take 60 decisions to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that gives each one.
I have 56 degrees outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is vary the order in which decision <unk>
So half of the clients are going to go from lots of choices, 56 colors, just four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from a few options, four boxes, on 56 colors, lots of options.
And what am I going to do that?
What do you are.
If you look at the default button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're being lost.
We found that those who are going from lots of choices to <unk> <unk> the <unk> button again and again and again.
The <unk>
If you go from a few options to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order in which information is presented.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although the choice does not say anything about the preferences of <unk> interior, in all ways they make us a choice.
We're excited about a product that we're building that we now have more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the overload of the overload of <unk> -- to get rid of alternate alternatives -- we can do it <unk> <unk> we can manage more categories at least <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I've introduced them were designed to help manage the <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of an election is being careful the <unk>
And the more careful we are in our better choices, we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the <unk> in the <unk> East Germany, if you had a typewriter I had to send it to the government.
I had to record a piece of text from written with the machine.
And this is why the government could track the origin of the <unk>
If they found a writing with the wrong message you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, how much this will make the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color printer from any big manufacturer and printing one page, that page ends with some yellow yellow dots on each page that follow a pattern that makes them own one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be very much like this.
This is an example of the ways our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If you look at what happens in the online world, we can set up the attacks according to their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> cell phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to make a lot of money, a huge amounts.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that they will build money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthieu <unk> <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys do their online <unk> but they do it by illegal means by giving to steal money from our accounts when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy on a computer computer.
The secret service of the U.S., two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know her <unk>
And I say that today is more likely that any of us is a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this goes from bad in worse.
In the future, most crimes are going online.
The second group of suicide in the importance we're looking at today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, and motivating the protests, do motivate them to motivate us, <unk>
<unk> are <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main suicide <unk> the criminals who do it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous that they do to protest and the last group are the United States United States the governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government against its own citizens.
<unk> is an authority.
<unk> the world's last fall because of a <unk>
Let's get the safety of the site and borrow a <unk>
Last week I said, in a meeting with the Dutch government representatives I asked one of the leaders if you were <unk> <unk> the death of people because of the attack to <unk>
And the answer from he was yes.
So how do people die from a attack of these?
<unk> is an Irish authority.
<unk> <unk>
What are the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except that they were <unk> a foreign authority.
And he was going to have <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt at the headquarters for the <unk> secret police headquarters in April 2011, and during the state of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes of a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government to intercept the Egyptian government to intercept the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 15,000 euros to the Afghan government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide the tools to government governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by German government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're <unk> in a case of criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
They <unk> the Internet connection.
It even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and to listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious response should be "Well, it seems something wrong, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to do to you.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in game the privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right that we have today will be forever.
They were blindly trained in any future and a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that you have to care about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live in Kenya, in the southern part of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, at the background, and behind the cows, the National Park.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences over the south, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate outside the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our <unk>
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and so soon we got up in the morning and found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we believe that we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and that's why we value it.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of lions.
People are the warriors who protect our community and livestock and they're also angry with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is about a few in the National Park.
A child in my community, for the age of nine years old, is responsible for the cattle.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought lions were scared of.
But I realized that this doesn't really blame me, because even he was helping lions see the pen <unk>
I didn't tell you <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
And she was trying to trick male lions so they believed that I was near the <unk>
But lions are very smart.  They came up the first day and they saw the <unk> and they were gone, but the second day, and they came up and said, this thing is not going to be moving, and it's always here.  So just just just and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day the lions <unk>
I found that lions are afraid of the light that you move.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on that to turn out the lights off and off the lights.
And this is a little lamp.
Let's get it up.
As you can see, the solar panel load the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity at the small <unk> I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> get outside, because that's where the lions.
And that's how they see the lions when they come from night.
<unk> lights and <unk> the lions so you think I'm walking around the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my home two years ago and since then, we never had a problem with lions.
And the neighborhood houses did the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and male lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see the <unk> you can see at the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've set up in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used by all Kenya, for all Kenya, to scare other predators.
And because of this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International Law School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise money and <unk>
It even took my friends to my community and we set up lights in the houses that don't have them and teach them how to take them.
So a year ago, it was just a kid in the lawns of the <unk> the cows of my father, and he used to see flying planes and said that one day would be inside of you.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer in aviation and a pilot when you <unk>
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving cows from my dad and to lions, we can be with lions with no conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting is to listen to a story like yours.
So you got a scholarship. Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other inventions in the electric force.
What's the next one in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do one near electric -- CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know that they were already invented electric -- but I want to make mine.
CA: So I'm going to do it once, right now, right? and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: The <unk> Richard <unk> are something big.
We're going to go through them in every single step that I love a friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would spend all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned much from the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are enemies.
Although I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until it had all changed as a whole.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and myself never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my colleague sister.
And he said, "When we <unk> the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We're getting together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak. we're ready to die."
I was very <unk>
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
For a little time, when I walked in front of the train station, I saw something terrible I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead on the street, holding a kid in his arms looking at her hand in his mother's face without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about looking for them and their families.
A huge famine <unk> from North Korea to the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died for famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also became more and more prevalent the <unk> of energy, all around me was completely net at night except by the lights in China, just crossing the river since my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite satellite photo in North Korea in the night compared to the developing world.
This is the <unk> River, which serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating on the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I went out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of starvation I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for a short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like as refugee refugees.
But I soon learned that it's not just extremely hard, but dangerous, because the refugees North Koreans were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be brought to a horrible destination in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was actually made when I was arrested by Chinese police and <unk> at the police season.
Somebody had to be accused of being <unk> then I <unk> my skills in the Chinese language and asked me many questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the interrogation a officer said to each other, "This was a fake <unk> She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking for asylum
But many people can be arrested by Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Although the <unk> were eventually released after an international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape -- many other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that the North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all the world can be done in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I've decided to take a grant going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I was hoping for.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South Poles.
We are all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even went through a identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country I could call my pride with a pride.
Although I went to life in South Korea not easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the investment of income to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities were sending some money to my family, and as an expert, my family was going to be shifted to the force to a place outside the <unk>
They had to run away.
I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and I was going down to the border with North Korea.
Because my family could not speak Chinese, I had to get it in some way, for over 3,000 miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and I went through a Chinese police officer.
He asked all of all, and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be <unk>
When the Chinese official came to my family, she stood up and told him that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
He looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe border guards in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in <unk> capital.
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything by releasing my family, and we were so close to it, but my family was <unk> in prison at short distance from the South Korea.
I was going and came between the office of immigration and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man ask me, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English, and with a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man went to the ATM and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for two North Koreans and you take them out of prison.
I took it with all my heart, and I asked her, "Why am I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind <unk> <unk> a new hope for me and for the village to get them back when they were <unk>
And I showed myself that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the village <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But achieving their freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice of English language <unk> and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea, and the rest of the world.
Because many of us are still in contact with family in the way inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've received a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans a chance to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans in the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Center.
This is Center for <unk> stores of <unk> fast food, <unk> land.
So the planners of the city came together and they thought, we're going to change the name of the South Center for it to represent something else, so they changed to Los Angeles in South Los Angeles as if this <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles South   <unk> of <unk> fast food, <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans live in a food, Los Angeles Center, home for food places to take and eat in the car.
The funny thing is that the places of food to get killed more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles Center.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times more than say, Beverly <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
And I would stop seeing this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if they didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time they come out of the house you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in its <unk>
I see chairs of wheels and sold and sold as <unk> cars.
I see centers of <unk> <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
I also got tired of managing a 45 minutes back to buy an apple that has no pesticides.
What I did, was planting a forest forest in front of my house.
In a strip of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 meters x three feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it right.
And I said, "Well, I can do what come to me for <unk> because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
So it was how I decided to run it out.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we set up and we started planting our forest from food, trees -- you know, nine vegetables <unk>
What we do -- we are a kind of paid group ahead of it made by gardeners of all the entire city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone got <unk>
The city is <unk> me above and in summary, they gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> became <unk>
And I was saying, "Come on, right?
A order to plant food in a piece of land that no one else <unk>  So I was like, "Well, let's go away."
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had been written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> members who put a petition on <unk> with 900 <unk> was a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called me to say that we <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, let's go, why not?
L.A. is the city of the United States with more <unk> land.
It's <unk>
That's equivalent to 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space to plant <unk> million <unk> plants.
Why on earth don't you look like this?
<unk> a plant will give a few thousand thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Pole.
I grew up there. Let's get my kids there.
I became a part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me, and I'm actually going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grow my art.
Such an artist of <unk> who <unk> walls, I <unk> <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You'd be surprised to see what the earth can do, if you let it be your canvas.
You just can't imagine the amazing thing that's sunflower and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm witness to how my garden became a education tool, of the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the soil.
We are the land.
You'd be surprised to see how the kids.
<unk> is the <unk> act and provocative act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
In addition, they get <unk>
I remember one time, who came a mother and her daughter, and she was like the <unk> at night and they were in my yard, and they were looking very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that you were there, and I told you, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I saw people who were so close to me with hungry, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, "Do you not realize that people are going to steal your <unk>
So what I say, "Oh my God, I don't fear you go to <unk>
That's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to take it, but at your time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a bomb shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, they gave me their stories about how this had affected them and how they used to plant their mom and their grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed changed, so it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had, as a 50 people who come from, work and <unk> all in a volunteer.
If kids grow up, they will eat <unk>
If you grow any other <unk> they'll eat <unk>  But if none of this will be taught -- if you don't teach them how the food is affecting your mind and your body, they eat blind things you in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which they are sitting, and I see color kids that are on this path designed for them, that doesn't take them anywhere.
With <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids to get away from their communities to have sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we will never do it.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block block block where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into cafes healthy.
I didn't tell you.
I'm not talking for free, because the free is not sustainable.
The funny thing about sustainability, you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to try to work on people, take the kids on the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening markets from farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everybody to become <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We have to change the script of what a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
That <unk> take your <unk> OK?
That is their weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, you know, if you want to meet me, I don't call you if you want to sit on comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, you come into the garden with his <unk> so that we can plant something.
Peace Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> of <unk>   -- you probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road.
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days as today, when it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water in the asphalt that we <unk>
And especially if you're going on on your bike and these automobiles go, that's not very nice.
Also, asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a loud material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, we would want a <unk>
The solution for that is to make asphalt roads.
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, has pores and the water can go through it, so all the water is flow into the sides and you will have a road to drive, and it's easy to drive, and not <unk> water anymore.
Noise will also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very <unk> all the noise disappear, so it's a very quiet road.
It also has some <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> You see that in this highway the stones on the surface of the surface <unk>
First, a stone, then several more and more and more, and then ...  -- well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can harm your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also take more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create <unk> with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see how the damage looks like.
It's a <unk> asphalt as I said, so it only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light and the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> they <unk> and if they were <unk> they will be going down, and you will separate from the <unk>
So, if you drive down the road, you will take the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material to be <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use wool wool from that to clean up <unk> and we can cut the steel wool in pieces of small pieces, and we can mix these little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little bits of wool wool into it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use for <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel, is very good at that.
So what you need to do is to heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the stones will get back into the surface.
I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the great machine to <unk> here onstage.
<unk> is a similar system.
I put the show that I'm now going to take you to see what happened.
This is the show that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the shows.
We tested a lot of samples out there and then the government, really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So it gave us a bit of the road, 400 meters of the <unk> highway in which we had to do a test trial to test this stuff.
So that's what we did there, you see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road will last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road, and we tested them in the lab.
We did age samples, we put a lot of load into them, the <unk> then with our <unk> machine, and the <unk> and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've done a material using fibers of steel bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, and you can even double the life of the surface. It really will be saving a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they're curious about whether this also worked.
We still have the show here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, you have to cool first before I can show you how it works.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having aroused a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to BBC <unk> in his little gray radius.
He had a big smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news is usually <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> my father.
I didn't know what it was, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> <unk> he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were complaining about Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I would tell myself as a child to <unk> my older sister who could no longer be used outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way we could just get the two to <unk>
Every day, we made a different route so that nobody could suspect where we were headed.
We had to hide books in the market bag, so it looks like we were shopping.
The school was at a house, more than 100 of us had a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that we had our <unk> the teacher, the students and our parents.
And once in a while, the school suddenly had a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew of us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where <unk>
We were <unk> but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> from a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> where his daughter, my mother, went to school and why his father was born.
But my college mother got a teacher.
This is it.
It was left about two years ago, just to turn our home home for girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is, was the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk to not educate your children.
During the years of <unk> I remember that there were times that I was very frustrated by our life and was always scared, and I couldn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can let them leave your house for a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here -- and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we'll do it.
So, you still want not to <unk>
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than <unk> and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I meet here proud to graduate graduate from graduate school.
When I came back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> from her home to educate her daughters, was one of the first in <unk>
He not only <unk> from my university degree, but I also was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, I carry it driving on the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I think it's a big dream -- but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's because of what <unk> <unk> the first and maybe private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is, I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see his parents and their families that, like the mine, <unk> for them, despite the face of a <unk> opposition.
As <unk> it's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed a father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter would go from the way from <unk> to her village, and literally escaped to be killed by being killed by a bomb on the way for minutes.
When you get to his house, you get the phone, a voice told him that if he kept sending his daughter to school, they would go back to trying.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but you don't harm the future of my daughter for his old and say, ideas."
What I've been given to tell from Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of whom <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of her daughter and that she sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers haven't been key in our success.
In fact, they often are the earliest <unk> of the bright future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school to school with <unk> remember, was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the United States.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
I fear that these changes didn't make a lot, after the retirement of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school and their parents who <unk> for them, I see the future <unk> future and a durable change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the girls of <unk> I would tell you.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never forgotten my grandmother's words that died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never go back a revolutionary <unk>
It's almost two years since the revolution was inspired by the <unk> of mass <unk> both of the <unk> revolution, like <unk>
A forces with many other citizens moving inside and outside the country to call a day of anger and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men -- they were in the <unk> <unk> each of the regime, <unk> <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a <unk> <unk> in the face of the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west, the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war, and some losses from about 50,000 dead dead we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy load, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of the society.
<unk> of the devastation of the devastation of the challenges, I have loved -- with a lot of other women, rebuilding civil society -- <unk> a peaceful transition and fair transition to democracy and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national <unk>
There were approximately 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with unique enthusiasm I started organizing workshops about development of capacities and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women we founded the <unk> of Women <unk> <unk> a movement of women, a movement of women, who are very <unk> to advocate for the women's autonomy of the woman and for our right participation in the construction of democracy and peace.
I found myself a very difficult environment in the <unk> period an environment that was getting more and more <unk> that it was <unk> of selfish policies and exclusion.
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
The women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, a little bit, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American ambassador, and the attack on the <unk>
The other day we woke up with the news of the military murder of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their rapes of human rights of the prisoners and their lack of rule of law.
Our society, made up of a revolutionary mindset becomes more, and it has gone away from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> became the iconic of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all here today to deal with our history of the success of the <unk> <unk> and the elections.
I'm here today to confess that we, as a nation we choose wrong, we take the wrong decision.
We don't <unk>
Because elections didn't brought peace and stability and safety to Libya.
<unk> and <unk> between candidates and candidate brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated by selfish policies of domination and <unk> for men as women?
Maybe what it was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs national dialogue and consensus creation more than I needed the election, that just replaced the polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs <unk> representation of the <unk> more than I need to need the representation of <unk> and <unk> of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage, and I'll call days of anger.
We need to start acting as rules of compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female speech, not only <unk> but it also has to put the privacy instead of <unk> and collaboration rather than competition, <unk> instead of exclusion.
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> for the war, desperately needs to be in order to reach peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before they do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> which is known in all of the <unk> traditions -- has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the <unk> and <unk> that spans all of the humanity that men and women, from which all tribes and all the peoples have <unk>
And so just like the uterus covers completely the <unk> that grows inside, the divine extracellular matrix of compassion -- all the existence.
This is what it is like, "My mercy goes all the things."
This is what it is, "My nagging <unk> about my <unk>
That all of them will tell you the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a wonderful question that has an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is that everybody is going to look like why she's left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or a social worker, not an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. He was just at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> green <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my alma mater, me with a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The man, when anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trick, of love, where every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be your story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> English School at Harvard and I have an MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> <unk> between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I am almost 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can go to anyone, all the races, all the religions, all the levels of income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a women's problem.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse will only happen in <unk> <unk> and long duration of the families, the last place we want or we would expect to find <unk> which is why domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that was going to be a man who sticks, it and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States women in between 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other of the ages, and over 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I also was a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold, November night of January.
I was sitting next to my side in the subway of New York City and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just <unk> from a college of the <unk> <unk> and she was working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first meeting was that it was ready and fun, and it looked like a <unk>
He had some big <unk> like apples, and one hair, wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things he made <unk> from the beginning was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of a mate.
It did it about everything in the beginning of <unk> in a <unk>
We started out and loved everything about me, which was list, that he had gone to Harvard, I put passion in helping teenagers, and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as a woman had ever done it.
And it was why the <unk> of that <unk> school and work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much relevance to it.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was to go from New York and quit the work of my dreams, but I thought that I had to do sacrifices for your spouse, so I said, I quit my work and <unk> and I went together with Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling into a <unk> <unk> that was entering head in a physical trap and financial and psychological trap <unk>
The next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce violence to how it reacts to.
And this is where those weapons come in.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where it was supposed to be <unk> I had to feel so safe and bought three guns.
One was in the <unk> of the car.
And he kept it under the pillow in our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said he needed those guns to cause the trauma that lived in a small way.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message for me and, although I had never lifted my hand, my life was already serious danger, every single day.
The first <unk> physical attack happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises on my neck had disappeared, I put my mother's suit and married him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that I was sure that we were going to live happily forever, because I loved him, and he also wanted me a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just felt very <unk> by the wedding and the fact that we form a family with me.
I had been an isolated accident, and I never got any harm.
I spent two times more on our aging moon.
The first time I was driving up to a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so hard in the head that I <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back to our <unk> <unk> <unk> by traffic and threw a Big Mac cold to the face.
<unk> kept <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was excited when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three Americans is a victim of domestic violence or harassing at some point in their life, and the Centers for Disease Control says that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
To go back to my question: Why do I get <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the other hand, I was a strong woman, in love with a deeply <unk> man who was the only person in the world who could help <unk> tackle his <unk>
The other question that everybody does is why they just don't <unk>
Why not <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people make people, because we us, we know something that normally you <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is kill her.
More than 70 percent of the killings in domestic violence are happening after the victim has put the relationship, after the <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent harassment, even after the <unk> it has become married, <unk> of financial resources, and the manipulation of the family court court system to <unk> the victim and their children, who are normally forced by judges to spend time not to spend the man who would join their mother.
And we still keep asking why it is just not going?
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> he lifted my denial.
I realized that the man I loved so much, would have killed me if he had allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told all of the world: the police, my neighbors and my friends and familiar to complete strangers, and I'm here today because all of you will tell me.
We have the trend to <unk> victims as the <unk> <unk> women <unk> <unk> goods.
The question, "Why do you <unk>
For some people is a way to say <unk> is it by <unk> as if the victims <unk> intentionally <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also <unk> that learned that they learned a hopeful lesson of what happened to them and that they would save their lives and joyful lives like <unk> wives and mothers, fully free violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic domestic violence.
And I got married with a man cute and nice man and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to go back to have never more, is a gun <unk> by my head in the hands of someone who says I want.
At this time, as you're thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> which stupid <unk> but all this time I actually have been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, which are being <unk> or they were <unk> or they were <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting their daughter, her sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to put my crazy love to actually trace the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
abuse is only in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
<unk> the abuse of the light by talking about it with their kids, their coworkers and family friends and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors like fantastic people and <unk> who have a <unk> future.
They will bring the signs early from violence to intervene consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims of a safe <unk>
Together we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the oasis and <unk> that they should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this point, there's a uncomfortable tension in the room because I should not have dressed myself like this.  Fortunately, I have brought clothes to me.
This is the first change in clothes on a <unk> scenario, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women get sick when they <unk> they don't have to get them away, but find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of power to change what you think about myself in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These heels. They're very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is going to go through this sweater through your head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything as I cover your head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
<unk> is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed totally what you thought about in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
He was totally uncomfortable and the photographer said to me that he would raise the back and he would get the hair of the guy.
Of course, with surgery or an artificial <unk> like the one that I made two days ago for the work, there is very little that we can do to transform our looks, which, even though shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model here.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my work, that's going to be a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do it, but they <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to model model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> I was discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this heritage.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry and symmetry, which we are biologically programmed to <unk> we also have been associated with a high and <unk> shape, to <unk> and a white skin.
And that's my future <unk> that I've known to take money to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience who are now showing <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> <unk> <unk> there, <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for knowing so much of models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told all of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models, just <unk> -- which is less than four percent, and they were not white <unk>
The next question that people are always asking me is: Can you be a model when you <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't know.
But then, what really would tell you about each of these girls is: Why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> surgeon and ninja and poet, which would be awesome, because the first one.
If after this list of a spectacular list still <unk> No, no, <unk> I want to be a model, I said, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the head of <unk> of the American American magazine, or the next Steven <unk>
To say most of you want to be model is like to say you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you everything I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike <unk> surgery can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, you've already fixed your studies, and you have a stick and a few jobs on your back, no matter what you want, you know, if you want to be president of the United States, but you can pick up the Model Model cells for 10 years, people would look weird.
The next question that people are always doing is if all the pictures <unk>
And yes, virtually all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
So this was the first picture that I was excited about, and I was also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're getting into the personal field, but it was a little girl.
And so I looked at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am in a <unk> party.
Here I am with my football team and <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize I'm not me in those photos.
They're creations of a group of professionals, <unk> and photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and people and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people are always asking me is: "Is things for free?
I have too many 20,000 inches and I have never use, except the couple of the previous ones, but the privileges that I get is the ones I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a shop and I forgot to take money, and I was given the dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> and he jumped down a red light -- and of course, we would stand up and give me an <unk> agent to be able to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privileges <unk> for me, not what I am. And there are people who are paying for a price for their looks no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, of teenagers who were <unk> and 86 percent were black and Latino men, and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
How many times do I <unk>
When I investigate this talk, I learned that the 53 percent of <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes to 78 percent in the 17.
So, the last question that people ask me is: How is life of a model?
And I think the answer you expect is: If you're a little bit thinner and you have the most brilliant hair, you'll become very happy and wonderful hair.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe you can do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with creative people, ingenious people.
And all of that is true, but it's just one part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my view every day.
And if you ever ask, with some more thin legs and the most brilliant hair.
They just have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most <unk> little hair and the clothes that are likely to be -- but probably are the women physically <unk> on the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of race and gender oppression when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something to keep out of this talk, I hope you are all more comfortable by recognizing the power of the image in the perception of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was most enough enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 pictures -- I didn't have a little bit of <unk> and I wasn't me who <unk>
There were no <unk> directors and no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a small deal on lighting.
In fact, most of them were taken at random.
My story starts when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife pulled me this picture of holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and 5.
He happened to go back to New York City just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife said to me, why don't you take me to <unk> to New York on a <unk> journey, and you carry on your <unk>
So here is when we started asking for the tourists that were going to happen to get us to make the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, no one has <unk> with the camera.
And so we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day in a way that a five year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than displays of a particular moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop the time in a week of October and to think about our time and evolution over the years, not just at the physical level, but in all of the senses.
Because, though we always take the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter has new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how they perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something that we hope for illusion is all year.
Recently, on one of the travel, we were walking, when all of a sudden he stopped in my tracks and pointed out a red <unk> of the Barbie store that you would write small in the past few <unk>
And he described to me what it felt at the age of five years of foot in the same place.
He remembered that they remembered their heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create is memories.
So, I want to share the idea of being actively engaging in creating conscious creating memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the familiar pictures.
I'm always the one that takes the picture.
I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and you wouldn't go back to somebody and ask him, you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are found in the most <unk> <unk>
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney <unk> as a stupid silly characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press press, laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associate with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament are not <unk> the environment.  The <unk> are not helping prevent the spread of disease.
They're hardly <unk>   They're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.
There are the <unk> of the New World that are mainly found in the <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and World <unk> where we have 16 species of these 16, 11, face a high risk of extinction.
So why are the <unk> important, first of all, they provide vital ecological services.
They're the <unk> of natural waste.
They were breaking the cadavers up to the bone.
They help kill all bacteria. They will absorb the anthrax that would not be for them would be <unk> and cause great losses to livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the cadavers take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge historical importance.
They've been associated with the ancient <unk> culture.
<unk> was the symbol of the protective and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the city and below Egypt.
In the mythology we have <unk> the god <unk> and <unk> his life to save the Tasmanian <unk> of the Tasmanian devil <unk>
In <unk> culture, they are done very important to open open sky, in places like Tibet -- there is no place to bury the dead or the wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at extreme endangered.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there is conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a result, the <unk> are victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the <unk> critical list of extinction, that means that in less than 10 or 15 years ago, and the reason is because they fall prey on the livestock of livestock that has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned to use India in India and have taken a statement.
Since there's no <unk> there has been a spread on the number of dogs on <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs -- you have a huge time bomb for <unk> The number of cases of rage has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up the Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this to the birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk> of birds.
In Western Africa, there is a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the market of <unk>
So what are you doing? Well, we're looking at these birds. We're <unk>
We're trying to determine its basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so to focus on a sustainable problem is not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments at the middle level.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we have.
How can you help? It can become assets, you can write a letter to their government and tell you that we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures. They would look at their time to spread the word <unk> the word.
When you go out of this room, you would report on the <unk> but talk to their families, with their neighbors with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that it changed from opinion because he saw it to fly without effort, with no energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life -- has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> -- but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for a <unk> NGOs and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
And I would say to the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything we played on was <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where some Italians decided to teach people of Zambia to grow food.
So we got the seeds of <unk> the south of Zambia to this absolutely amazing valley that descends into the <unk> River, and we teach the locals to grow Italians and <unk> and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they would teach them to come to work, and sometimes they would have been <unk>  We were amazed that the locals in so fertile valley, they hadn't had agriculture.
But instead of asking you how it was possible that I was possible to do anything, we just said, "Thank God we're here."  <unk> time to save the people of Zambia from <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa is <unk> <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato fell to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, and we were saying to the <unk> "Look at the <unk>
When tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red at night in the morning, 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you say, "You're never going to be <unk>
I thought that only we were the Italians <unk> mistakes in Africa, but then, I saw what the Americans, they were doing what the men were doing -- what they did the morning and after seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
We can see the <unk> --  -- we will see the waste that we gave them to the <unk> people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We Western donors and we've delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not telling you about the damage that the money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage we have done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries -- and we treat people only two things: or <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the <unk> Latin <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I try to deal with anybody in a different culture like my kids, "I want you a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture like my <unk>
That's why white people in Africa are called <unk> <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face, "The little little <unk> written by <unk> who said for the whole economic development, if people don't want to be <unk>
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman was opened up this conference on the ground and said, "We can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided at 27 years only to respond to people, and they invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start nothing, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion -- the <unk> of the local people who have sleep to become a better person.
So what do you do? They <unk>
You never get to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We got together in a coffee <unk> we got together in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what do you do?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then, we helped them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge but knowledge is available.
So years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not a time, at one time, they will tell you, but not at <unk>
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the <unk>
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they never will say, in a public meeting, what you want to do with their own money, what have you ever identified.
So, planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know them, because they don't have their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one -- and we work face-to-face face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new career.
The profession is the medical doctor of the company, the family doctor of the business, which sets up with you in your home at the table of your kitchen table, and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a way to earn a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> in Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get away from this <unk> garbage that we got to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to me to see to ask: "How can you do that?
How can you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very, very difficult.
And so I <unk> and --   So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business counseling in history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before they get involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and an economy of company <unk>
<unk> is the kiss of death of the <unk>
So now we <unk> <unk> <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to talk with you.
You have to offer <unk> privacy, it has to be fantastic to help.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What will you talk to you about this tomorrow?
Local <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So, what I'm telling you is that the entrepreneurship is where it is.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossil fossils -- <unk> <unk> and from one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of holding <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> to communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, the <unk> <unk>
The government?
They will be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There is a very good story that was in a magazine -- many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> he gathered up this group of people -- and I would save it about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City was not within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population keeps growing up to this <unk> to move the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in dung.  And so in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> life in New York.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States there were <unk> manufacturers <unk> <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few factories in the world that were <unk>
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
But there's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, you have to offer them to <unk>
Otherwise, they're not going to talk to you with you.
Then, you have to give me an absolute <unk> service.
And then I later get to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smaller company, the largest company, has to be able to do three things -- <unk> the product you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to count with a fantastic marketing and you have to count with a great financial administration.
You know what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can do, sell and look for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This was still not born.
We have looked at the time and looked at the 100 <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> Ford, all new companies, Google, <unk>
There is only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, just one: None of it was started a single person.
I would never have the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it started.
No one begins a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a little bit of small business <unk> in <unk> in bars with their dedicated <unk> who will do for you, what somebody did for you, what someone did for this gentleman who talks about this <unk> somebody who asked you, what needs it take?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> it can be <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." Tell you to <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't swap a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door in a bad moment?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand our <unk>
How do you share more of our hopes to empty stores so that our communities can reflect on our needs and dream today.
I live in New York, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> who give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It always stops the music.  There is a show in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the most beautiful <unk> property properties.
I live near this house, and I thought it could turn it into a <unk> space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and he thought a lot.
And this led me a profound gratitude for the living time.
It gave it clarity to the significant things of my life today.
But let's try to keep this look in my daily life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to catch up the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this house house on a giant scanner, and painted about her phrases to <unk> "Before she died <unk>
So, <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled and kept <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I die of the dying, I want to be <unk>  Before I die I want to sit on the line of <unk>
Before I died, I want to sing for millions of people.
Before we die I want to plant a <unk>
Before we die of the <unk> I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I died, I want to get it back again.
Before I died, I want to go to the Treasure rescue.
Before we die I want to be totally myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and the hope and hope of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort in tough times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's trying to understand our neighbors in new ways and <unk> It's about giving the reflection of thinking and <unk> and remembering what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to do a wall in their community.
And so with my colleagues in the inner civic center we did a kit and now have been made walls around the world, like Kazakhstan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we show the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions increasing, is more important than ever, finding ways of conserving the perspective and remembering that life is brief and fragile.
The death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that we get more power.
You think about the death of our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect what matters as individuals and as community and more media to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us cannot only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
<unk> is 22 and very hot.
Not speak, but transmits joy that some of the best <unk>
<unk> knows what love.
It's shared. <unk> happen to happen.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color color.
It doesn't matter the religious differences and focus on this: never <unk>
When singing songs of our childhood, trying to be a words that I don't even know -- it reminds me of one thing: how little thing that we know about the mind and how wonderful it should be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. He's very hot.
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember whether I stole my <unk> but he remembers the year I went out every single songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, getting my arm in my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and my Lady shot.
Isn't that <unk>
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of a society, often they're <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case -- even though you don't consider them within it, that could only mean one thing: which were <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, and learning and sometimes physical skills.
In every individual it manifests itself out in a different way, and that <unk> is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, we will be diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that faster in the world, there's no cause or <unk>
I disagree with my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was only three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
He was living and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and I was pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the cars in row around the room, looking at the washing machine and eating anything that was in the <unk>
As I grew up, it would get more different, and the differences were made more <unk>
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature -- a child who saw the world without anything -- a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some tough moments in my family, moments where I wish that they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that they're things that I wouldn't want to change the normal.
The normal thing about the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that any of you are wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and by Sam and you would be that you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift inside and frankly, the pursuit of <unk> is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the time when we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what has been to be <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a teacher of communications, who gave me a class of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  Actually, I was able to get rid of these students with their big minds, their big books and their big words and their big <unk>
But when those conversations, I felt what I was going to do, must have felt like when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
I felt like I had those conversations when I had the students. I was surprised by ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a big communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones who are attacking our greatest challenges from energy to environment and health care between others, and if we don't know what we don't understand about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited us to see their world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and that your engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why is science relevant to us.
Not simply tell us that we study the <unk> but we study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing their science carefully, with the <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and marketing, which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing to make them dumb things.
Instead, as Einstein, as Einstein said, it's just as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can clearly communicate their science without engaging ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- they're kind of <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And by presenting your work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you wondered why they're called <unk>  What do you do the <unk> bullets -- kill them, and they <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it's being supported too much in the language area of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it actually inspired the only of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple line, <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then provide graphs that we will adapt to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what it is <unk>
I think these are just a few keys that can help all other open we open the door and see the country of the wonders that's science and engineering.
And so scientists, and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all the media -- <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from the entire English English <unk>
Just because it sounds very good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was a <unk> editor of the 19th century that he defined that much better when he said, "A <unk> is that it seeks a public charge -- no matter what the platform is looking for, or very beginning, and that when he won, it gets the mere mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know you have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the camera <unk>
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the <unk> <unk> who was confronted by <unk>
They turned into the Tower of London and <unk> it, but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end of it had a popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later, we had the first recorded use of the phrase <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's because of the freedom of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, their leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions that you might have anticipated.
Some wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the U.S. <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was tested quality.
And not even with it were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a given deadline for a given term.
And there might be <unk>
The whole world got tired of it, because this debate was going on for three weeks.
I read the day of a poor <unk> and always <unk> "Not with this <unk>
The <unk> and <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives did not want Washington to be <unk> of power.
They didn't want to call it King for if he would give him or her "no" to his designated ideas.
So, they wanted to give the <unk> <unk> more <unk> and more unfortunate than they came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. I didn't invented the title. There was existed before, but it just meant <unk> that we would have a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a <unk>
And that's why the Senate <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign together and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take a serious title with a title as ridiculous as <unk> as <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate was not <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite one to where I have been able to figure out, the Senate has never <unk> it as the President's child.
President Barack Obama tried to keep there, waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that one measure is <unk>  <unk> possible that we keep waiting for <unk> years more.
But the third thing that we can learn, and this is the most important, and this is the most important, and that is that I want to tell you, is that the U.S. President of the United States doesn't sound as modest today in the day, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads to note, the world's largest economy in the world and a fleet of air vehicles and so on.
Reality and history have endowed with the title of <unk>
So at the end I won the <unk>
<unk> your title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was an <unk> then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has five nuclear <unk> etc.
So, at the end of the Senate I won and the House of Representatives <unk> because no one is going to be feeling humble when you tell them that now are the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to give you to you.
politicians try to choose and use the words to shape and control the reality, but actually change a lot more the words than what they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to <unk> in a illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is loaded with heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak but above all, that cacophony of male <unk> and stones and <unk> with red tools.
Like the other hand, I carry a cheap light of light from <unk> strapped into his head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole in a meter that falls hundreds of meters on the ground.
He <unk> my hand, and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met over it, who lost control and dropped countless feet into that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are at the deep part of that hole in risk their lives without any reward, and often, dying.
And I went home from that hole and I went home, but they may never will.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people that I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO who is dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started to learn about slavery because I knew that there was in the world but not just a grade.
When we ended up talking to me, I was very excited about ignoring this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
It was made up my stomach and a few weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
Some of them even considered my second home.
But this time, we would get the dirty ones.
A conservative calculation says that there are now more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice as much as the number of Africans moved through the whole of the slave <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a slave slave was about three times the annual salary of an U.S. worker.
The equivalent of <unk> <unk>
And yet, today we can take entire families for generations for generations for <unk> <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates profit from over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false career promises of good education and better work to discover that they are forced to work without pay, under threat to violence and can't escape.
The slavery today operates in the <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable them.
<unk> exists in most of the world and yet it's illegal throughout the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the brick <unk>
This weird and formidable show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> at a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, kids, in fact, entire families <unk> in a heavy canopy of <unk> stack in their heads, until 18 at the time, and they take them from <unk> <unk> to trucks that are hundreds of feet.
<unk> on the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> work in silence, do this task over and over for 16 hours a day.
There was no coffee eating, not to drink, and the severe <unk> would make you just pee out quite <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to touch and let it work.
Every 20 minutes I had to run to the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a lot better treatment than these people.
Back in <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly grabbed me and he said, <unk> I don't know. Don't do it here."
And it explained to me very clearly that to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me, but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct aid.
I couldn't give you money, nothing.
I was not citizenship in that country.
I could put them into a worse situation than they were already in the world.
I had to rely on the <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for his release and she trusted the <unk>
As soon as I was waiting to get home to feel my <unk> heart.
In the Himalayas I found kids carrying stones for miles away by <unk> land to trucks that were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the children who charge the charge and the kids would take them to their heads with <unk> <unk> made of clubs, ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they are slaves -- and they work 16 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all their life.
They have nothing to do with it.
When these <unk> <unk> their freedom, <unk> <unk> totally their houses.
When you hear the word slavery we often think about sexual trafficking and because of this global consciousness, I would tell you that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk> sex.
It was led to a little bit of <unk> which would give this little dirty basement of faint light.
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, are local <unk>
They have small rooms -- private rooms -- where <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of the only seven years -- are forced to entertain customers and to buy more food and alcohol.
Each of them is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse to their clients.
On the <unk> I remember making sense of <unk> <unk> and at that moment, I could barely imagine what it should be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs where you were going.
There was no <unk>
There were no windows for <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because you touch a very difficult issue, it's important to point out that slavery even sexual trafficking, is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people in agriculture, in the restaurants, in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as a <unk> sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to labor <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families <unk> in the trade of silk.
This is a family portrait.
The black hands of black are the father, the <unk> of blue and red from their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and lower silk in the liquid to the <unk> but the <unk> is toxic.
My translator told her stories.
"We have no <unk> they said.
We don't hope, though, that we can go out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are over 4,000 children in the Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we got there, I went on a quick look quick.
I saw what seemed to be a fishermen family on a boat, two older brothers, some younger children -- some younger children -- it makes sense, right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
Children are separated from their <unk> families who have been forced and forced to work extensively in these boats on the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat went up there was <unk> the subject that her little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into water.
The branches of the trees plunged into Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, and with fear, it's thrown out of water to unlock the branches.
Many <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to flee and like life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> it is to the youngest slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they took the last five of the networks, but they had been working on the last one.
<unk> and <unk>
And it will point out that these networks weigh more than 400 pounds when they're loaded with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued by a village of fishermen.
I met him in a refuge where the <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes is possible.
Who will come to be because someone decided to make a difference in their life?
<unk> on a road in Ghana with <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his motorcycle suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and played the window.
He asked us to take it down on a land path to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we got to get out of the car, and he asked the driver that it would go very quickly.
Then you signal this path down and he said, "This is the way, this is the road. <unk>
As we started to go off, we took away the <unk> that would take the way and after walking close to an hour we found that the road was <unk> for the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of pictures on my head as I went back in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> path ended up <unk> in a clear, and we had a mass of holes that could fit into a football field, and they were all full of enslaved.
A lot of women had tied to their backs, and while they were looking for gold, <unk> in water <unk> with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember he looked at his eyes, tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The wells are up to 90 feet and these people carry together with a heavy stone bag that then they would be brought to another area where they were putting the stone to be able to extract the gold.
First sight, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer, if you look closer, on the margin we see to work less lucky and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ends up like this victim of T.B. and <unk> <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died he took him to work with him in mines.
When you die in your uncle, they <unk> the debt of the uncle that the force to be slave in mines.
When I met him, I'd worked in the 14 years and the injury of the leg that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so severe that the doctors said that it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
And yet, he dreams with being liberated and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and this is this kind of determination, in face to a remote possibility that makes me a lot of respect.
I want to throw light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we're testimony to them and that we will do everything that we can to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. They're from people, real people, like you and I, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day going to happen that I don't think of these many beautiful people that I have had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images show a force in those who you see, in people like you, and I hope that that force turns into a fire and that fire grows light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do applied mathematics, and there is a peculiar problem for whom <unk> are like the management Department.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today I will try to explain to you what I do.
And dance is one of the most human activities.
We will tell you the <unk> of the <unk> and the dancers of <unk>  that we will see later on.
But the speaker demands a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of dexterity and probably some initial <unk> that may well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's disease, destroy gradually this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at his time, was a virtuous dance.
In the last few years, it has made a lot of progress in treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with an <unk> <unk> weakness <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need objective tools to detect disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way and ultimately the only way we will know if there's really a cure to be when we have an objective measure of objective and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement are not <unk> that's why they don't deal with the blood and the best thing we have is a neurological test for 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside of the clinical trials, they never do.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the test they themselves?
You don't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the neurological clinic.
So what I want to do is be <unk> as a conventional way for a try, you can see, in a certain sense, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of the elastic ropes.
It shows someone healthy as it emits sounds at speaking. We can imagine as dancers of a <unk> <unk> because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds, and we all have the genes that are required.
And as <unk> it requires an extraordinary training level.
Let's think about time that leads to a child learn to speak.
From sound, we can track the vocal chords of vocal cords as we <unk> and as the Parkinson's is affecting the <unk> also affects the <unk> organs.
On the bottom line you can see an example of <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
Get a vocal, <unk> <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these exams based on the voice <unk> <unk> <unk> Well, both of them are <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do them.
They're both <unk> OK, but they are also <unk> and based on voice are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, they have about 30 seconds like a lot.
They are <unk> and we all know what happens to us.
When something takes a cost so <unk> it appears to mass scale.
These are some incredible goals to address.
We can reduce the patient difficulties in the patients.
I wouldn't need to go to the clinic for <unk> <unk>
With high-definition monitoring, we could get objective data.
We could make a mass of low cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it's too late.
So by giving you the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's <unk>
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local lines accessible to about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no disease, it can call up low price and leave recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So let's take all of these samples of, let's say 10,000 people, you can say who's healthy and who isn't it?
What will you get from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call -- you have to indicate whether you have or not the disease. Right.
<unk> You see, some people may not exist. You may not do it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data in different circumstances, and to do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion of confusion for the real markers of the disease.
TR: They have a precision <unk> at this moment?
It's much more than that.
Actually, my graduate student, I have to <unk> it has done a fantastic job and now has shown that it works on the mobile phone network as well, what we would take the project. Now we have a 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of 2011, I was making <unk> in New York City.
We're real <unk> creatures.
We lie in the dark, in empty rooms, and by large, we avoid sunlight.
We do with thin models even more <unk> the perfect perfect skin, even more perfect we do and we do it in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste of images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my home as well as the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
A long time later, an organization where I was <unk> there, <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the response team.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
The 13th of May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little bit of <unk> people in the <unk> <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave.
The level of the water water reached over 24 feet tall and over three kilometers into the ground.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
We were taking debris from channels and <unk>
We took the mud removed and we left the <unk> and we leave ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took off tons and tons of dead fish -- <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the locals found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> and cameras and cameras and cards.
Everybody did the same thing.
<unk> and take them to different places of the peoples around the <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As opposed to the wave, and to save their lives, they had to leave absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
I helped clean up the stall, huge <unk> giant <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the <unk> center would look at the photos.
And I had the honor and I had the honor that that day <unk> in me to clean the photos.
And this was exciting and so on. I had heard the expression to think beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I moved beyond my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some that they had over a hundred years -- some people were still in the lab, I couldn't stop thinking how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I went on on Facebook contacted with some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started putting the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too much <unk> but where the water had caught up, the face of the girl should be <unk> with a lot of precision and <unk>
In other ways, that little girl would not have the aspect of her himself, and that would be as tragic as having the picture <unk>
With the passage of time, they got a lot more pictures and they needed more <unk> so it went back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people in 12 countries volunteered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we got to <unk> a village to Northern <unk>
Once at the week we use our scanner in the libraries of time <unk> that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that we <unk> in <unk> is a different story: depended on course of the photos.
It could make an hour. I could make a couple of weeks.
It could make months for months.
This <unk> had to draw pretty much by hand using the areas that the color and the <unk> and the water had no <unk>
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures <unk> in saltwater, covered bacteria, with seaweed, even oil, all of it together with the step of the time I continue to stand up, and that's why <unk> was a major part of the project.
We couldn't tweak the picture unless I was clean clean and dry it for his <unk>
We had luck with the <unk>
We have a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more the pictures already <unk>
As one time <unk> the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky in relation to the photos.
He had begun to <unk> her, but she stopped to realize that we got them even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and his face would not have been able to afford it, we could take the images into one photo and tinker with the whole picture.
When they collected their photos he shared something of his story with us.
A few colleagues in her husband found the photos on a fire station between the rubble that I used to be their house, but his colleagues were <unk>
The tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Her young children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took him a week to find his whole family and know that everybody had survived.
The day he gave him his photos of her son at the age of 14.
For her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift that he could <unk> something that he could remember from the past that would not have been marked on that day day when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined up to <unk> hundreds of them helped us clean up for more of <unk> photographs, the great <unk> -- the vast majority came back to the hands of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us to bring back to 90 hundred hundreds of photos and <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend over <unk> and materials, most of the ink for <unk>
We took pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, one place, a relationship, someone loved.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would take to you, but the first thing that we will look for.
What about this was the project of restore small pieces of humanity, to give someone their connection to the past.
When a picture like this comes back to someone, it makes a huge difference in the life of the person that the <unk>
This project also made a huge difference in life of <unk>
Some of them connected to something bigger -- to get something bigger back, using their talent for something that doesn't be thin models of perfect skin.
To finish this email I would like to read this electronic email -- he sent him over the day I went back from Japan after six months.
As I was <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a photo with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathering around a baby, and I got excited about a baby, and I got a picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, and my <unk> daughter hangs out of our wall.
In the entire world, in all the few our basic needs are the same. Right?
Thank you.  Thank you.
<unk> <unk> was inspired by wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in an exhibition of just a billionth of a billionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not about a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technique so fast that you can create a slow camera of light in motion.
And with that we can create cameras that can look after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and really challenge the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch on and put it into a second <unk> whatever, in a number of <unk> to create a whole package of photons just a millimeter of wide width of it.
And that package of photons, and that <unk> travel to the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet is a commons.
If we take that bullet and this package of photons and we shoot it into this bottle, how do you disperse that photons into this <unk>
What is the aspect of light in the <unk>
Now, all of this --   Now remember, all of this is actually in less than a <unk> that's what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research --  -- <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into a bottle of photons that starts to <unk> and that, inside, starts to <unk>
Some of the light is <unk> and we start seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the lid and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces inside.
In that time, the waves travel along the table and because of the insights from the top of the bottle, it looks at the bottom of the bottle, after several pictures, that the insights are <unk>
Now, if we take a common bullet and current and we make it go the same distance and we see it at a slow camera at about 10 billion times, how much think it would take us to sit down to see that film?
A day? In reality, a week?
It would be a very boring movie --  of a slow bullet moving.
And what about doing with <unk> nature.
And you can see the waves that are <unk> from the table of the tomato and the wall of the bottom.
It's like throwing a rock into a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought of a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look at once more and more of this tomato you'll realize that, as the light gets rid of the tomato sauce, they don't <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces inside it and it comes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phone, they will be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to touch it.
What do we create this camera in the <unk>
As a photographers, you know, if you take a picture of a low exposure, it comes very little light around.
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than the shortest exhibition, so I'll just get some light.
So we sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded one and again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data into crude and <unk>
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, other heroes.
And if a new power of a inner future would allow you to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw a little bit of light on the door, you get to go into the room, a part of it is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
You could get those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left is our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in <unk> <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will come back to the camera but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so quickly, our <unk> has unique capabilities alone.
It has very good time resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also to the hidden objects but we don't know what extent it corresponds to what a distance.
When you project a laser you can record a photo in <unk> that, you see on the screen, it really doesn't make any sense.
But we're going to take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, we are bringing them and we're going to try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we will be able to see the object of the object.
Can we see it in 3D <unk>
This is our reconstruction now.
We have things to explore before we pull this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are <unk> with what's back on the curve, right?
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at light reflected by open windows.
Or we could build <unk> capable of seeing the inside of the body by <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue, and the blood is quite hard, so this is actually a request to scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new modality of visualizing the problems of the next generation.
Just like <unk> <unk> himself became a scientist, and it became the science of art, an art of photography.
And I realized that all the data points that we harvest is not just for scientific visualization, but we can see it.
It's going to create a new form of computational photography, with slow motion and code code.
And look at those waves. Remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But this is also something fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are getting away from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out that as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects, Einstein would have liked to see this picture.
The order that the events happen in the world are often invested in the camera.
They will take the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's <unk> Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can change life, and it gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone, a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song, and you would go to <unk> and get famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
And here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are <unk> in search of change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathered in searching for a change, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who are you doing a phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phones up.
<unk> a Android, <unk>
It's a lot. Most of you today have a mobile phone.
But today I'm going to talk about my mobile, and how it changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
<unk> <unk>
Why is that information that is there?
Because in 2006 the summer of 2006 the E.U. Commission introduced a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This offer says that every European telephone company, every vendor on all Europe, has to store a wide range of information range from users.
Who calls to whom. Who sends an email to whom.
Who sends a text to whom.
And if we use your mobile phone, where we are.
All this information is stored at at least six months, and even two years, in their telephone company or your Internet provider or your Internet.
And across Europe people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want telephone phone and Internet providers, all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said that this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of East Germany.
And I also asked myself if this works really work.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> who at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, that please give me all the information they had on me.
I asked them once, and I got them to ask up, and I didn't get a particular answer -- it was all right.
But then I said, "I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
And so I decided to take a court demand because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said, no, we don't give you this information.
At the end of the end, it agreed.
I would take the demand and they would send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly about brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> 30 lines.
At the beginning I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge file.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a bit <unk> what should do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step night, what am I doing.
But then I said, "I want this information to <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the <unk> of data.
So next to <unk> <unk> and Open He came up with this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and celebrate, go back and go forward.
You can see every step I give it.
And you can see how I'm going from <unk> to <unk> and how often I call the way.
All of this is possible with this information.
That day a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
But of all of us.
First of all, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, we talk a couple of times.
And then they call me a few friends and they call me each other.
And then you call the other, and the other one to the other, and we ended up with this big communication network.
You can see how their people communicate with each other to what time they call each other, to what time you sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control their society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the form of your society, because you know who you talk to who, who sends an email to "Who is all possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all of these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> would have known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And as a result, not the fall of <unk> <unk>
Because today the state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible within and out of the web.
They want to have the possibility of keeping our lives and they want to get them up forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital era is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for the self-determination.
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to tell your friends that privacy is a 21st century value and that is not <unk>
When you go home, tell your representative that just because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information they store of you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones that give you to remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hi TEDWomen, what happens?
Not enough.
Hi TEDWomen, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me to the world.
I would take my mom six times in six different directions.
As a result, I have brain palsy, which is why we will save all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
Muhammad <unk>
I P. C is not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one would <unk> the uterus of my mother, not the <unk> because my parents were brothers, but they are.
It just happens by accidents, such as the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration. And I don't want any of us in this room.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, you wish to be disabled.
Let's go for a ride.
Christmas Christmas -- you're in the shopping mall, drive in circles looking for parking lot, and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled people.
And think, "God, I can be at least a little <unk>
Moreover, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and P. C. It's just one of them.
There was a <unk> of <unk> I would win the gold.
I'm a <unk> Muslim <unk> and I lived in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe they should do it.
I am from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my illness had the same initial ones.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York, it might.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe in <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three biggest sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three older sisters went to public school, my parents went to the school system and <unk> that I was also out there, and if I didn't take all the ultimate note -- all of the most of the <unk> my mother.
My father taught me to walk in the age of five to my feet in his feet and just walking.
Another tactic I used was to hang on a dollar in front of me so that you can do it.
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walking up as a professor driver, who's received a lot of <unk>
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and they're still all of the family.  I think nobody realized that we were not <unk>
This was before 9/11, and the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> as a campaign.
The people I grew up with no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of <unk> that were all hungry during the <unk>
And I told them that I had enough fat to live three months without eating it, so I read from dawn at sunset it's very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> I mean, <unk>  My parents could not pay physical therapy, so I was sent to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I am from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I too.
And when my friends were going to spend summer vacation summer at the coast of Jersey, I wasn't coming.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we would get in <unk>
On summer vacation often my father was trying to be <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> and I was drinking hip cups on the back, I was stuck at the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was thinking, "Hey, <unk>
But the <unk> cure was the yoga.
I should say that it's very boring, but before I was doing yoga was a comedian of <unk> that I couldn't stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can put it in the head.
My parents would tell this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be in the <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a scholarship to the University of the state of Arizona, because it was in all the <unk>
It was like the pet <unk> of the theater department.
Everyone <unk> me.
I made all the tasks of the least smart, I took the top note in my classroom, and also in their classes.
Every time I did a scene from the glass zoo my professors <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow on Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with <unk>
I was a girl with <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> "The End will have a <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of it, we finally opened up.
Thanks to God <unk> I finally am <unk>
I did not get the paper.  You gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the head of the theater, crying crying as if somebody had killed my cat, ask her why and she told me that because they thought I couldn't make the risk scenes.
And I said, "Excuse me, if I can't do the <unk> you can't do the <unk>
It was a paper that was literally born and gave it to an actress without <unk>
I was mimicking my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors who have no disability for disabled papers.
When I graduated from when I came home, and my first tour tour, it was as extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew that it would be <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, it was there as a <unk> I didn't see myself more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that the <unk> <unk> non-state actors, with disability.
It's just <unk> to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I became <unk>
In my first tour, he took famous comics from New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that led when he fell into the account that I was at high speed on the New Jersey highway with a driver that had <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little disgusting rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find us very fun.
In 2003, my brother with another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> Festival of New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and then remind the <unk> that <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
<unk> to Arabs were much easier than fighting the stigma challenge of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news program for the cable <unk> It has been behind with Keith <unk>
I came up as if I went to a graduate dance dance, I went to a studio and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, "Excuse me, you can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I'm clinging to the host desk to not get out of the screen during the <unk> and when the interview, I was <unk>
At the end I had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't have me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was like <unk> and I hit my chair.
Something fun that I learned in right with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
The children are said that kids are <unk> but they never fall away from me and even older than me.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became an object of <unk>
I would read clips online with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist.
What disease does you have?
We should really pray for her."
A <unk> suggested I even would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is so visual like race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't do for <unk> then you can't make someone in the wheelchair.
<unk> are -- yeah, <unk> man. Come on.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors were saying that I didn't get <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, to have grown up with media, I don't think we <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images -- that's less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need all of the society to teach our children.
My near-death journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I got to <unk> by the red carpet by the <unk> of the soap <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a film with Adam <unk> and to work with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity to give the Palestinian refugees a few of what my parents would tell me.
It was the only time my father saw me live alive, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child in a small people.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
It lives in a little town in the South <unk>
This village is near <unk>
<unk> drives a small town to poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
No for him there, it's going to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, no job, no longer <unk>
He just lived in a tent outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day you get a guy who offers him to take him back after dinner, and <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
He gets a little money to buy new clothes, money to send home their family.
They presented to a young man.
They finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, bursts a car bomb.
That kid in that small town with dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> a connected organization connected to the Qaeda.
So how do the story of a little boy who was trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends up with he <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, waiting to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing he arrived.
This was the first thing that got it out of what we call the <unk> <unk>
And their story is repeating in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban urban <unk> who <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young people, the promise of city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity, of labor, of well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who suffer from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them opportunities, the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door to access terrorism, to violence, to <unk> to be the history of cities 2.0.
And in my city of birth, they <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent of them don't work, it's not going to school.
They do virtually nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit <unk> Hospital.
I remember being in the hospital that I was looking at to you thinking, "Well, if I never gone?
And if I was forced to be in that same <unk> of <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support some juvenile leaders at a business height.
They went to about 90 juvenile leaders.
We sat down and we had an rain of ideas about the solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, that because I was a graduate college college college university -- it was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other organizations terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get to the point A is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
It started a company of <unk>
It started <unk> motorcycles to local residents who they normally couldn't afford to.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some time to expand hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is it different this story?
What does this story different?
I think its ability to identify and harness a new opportunity.
It's the business spirit, and I think the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against the <unk> of <unk>
And they will inspire young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that they're looking for so much.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was trained to train some of the young people at the summit of the corporate initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business policy.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were plastic sent from overseas.
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw <unk>
For those of you who grew up in the civil war, the answer would be: <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and <unk> design.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started to grow <unk> and <unk> that he said, could survive the hard climate <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for marriages, creating gardens in the houses, and the companies of the city, and now it's working on the creation of the first prime park in <unk> in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where the families, the young people, can go together, and as he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he is not grown.
So, the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought to work for an NGO, to work for the government, but their history, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
For the end of the day, they had innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
They provide business solutions for local problems.
So, inspiring young people and creating a design culture culture, it's really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need experience and guidance to <unk> and put it into the development and put it out of their business.
<unk> the young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support that they need to move from conception to the creation, and create an <unk> to the urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is something else to start a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed not simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His Peace Park, so it's how it's called, when it's created, when you actually transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired kids on the street to help rent and keep <unk> for him.
It gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to become young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and <unk> their <unk> innovation and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks of Peace <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about ten years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> an area <unk> in New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The <unk> forest.
The sun would make the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not to be on the way that we had to <unk> we could almost pretend that we were the first human beings to step on the ground.
We got to our camp.
It was a <unk> in a <unk> with a beautiful lens lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four square feet with apple hearts -- <unk> balls of paper aluminum <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
<unk> who were too lazy as to pull out what they thought I was going to clean up their <unk>
That question went on with me, and it was <unk> a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how you <unk> or where do you choose the <unk> who <unk> our trash in <unk>
Who cleans our trash in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
Here in New York City, the Department of <unk> cleans our trash, to reason by 11 tons of waste and two tons of products -- every day.
I wanted to meet you as individuals.
I wanted to understand who I do that work.
What do you feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through their pathways, and I interviewed people in offices and facilities around the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to go into more.
So I began to work like garbage <unk>
Now I wasn't just traveling in the trucks. I was <unk>
And I took the mechanical boards and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about smell.
It's there, but it's not as ubiquitous as you believe it, and in the days it is very strong, you get very quickly.
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies were still <unk> the weight of getting on their body tons in garbage every weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of Latin states, the collection of waste is one of the most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and getting into the traffic all the day and they're humming around you.
They just want to tell them, so generally the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for <unk>
And also, the crap itself is full of dangers that often fall in the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the relentless of the trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
It never stops coming.
It's also as a form of breathing or circulation.
It always needs to be moving.
And it's also stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I think the <unk> of waste are the most important work on the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first protective of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste of the waste and effective way each day, this begins to trace their slices and their dangers inherent to us in very real ways.
We had controlled for decades and centuries back to come back and start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old thing, we don't have space for what the drivers of the economy start to fail when it's in danger of the <unk>
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just pointing his relationship.
And then it's what I call our average average speed necessary.
And so I mean just at the speed that we used to move used in the <unk>
We usually do not <unk> we have no fancy <unk> or we have our cup of coffee, our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use them, we forget them, because we know that there is a job force on the other side that will take for you.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about waste collection that maybe help to reduce the stigma and adapt into that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They are on the street every day, in a form of <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when you <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
It's almost a form of relief.
The flow that keep us except for ourselves, of our own <unk> our own <unk> and that flow always needs to stay in shape or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a collection of waste collection on the street, grabbed my little little little baby, and there was a man doing his journey from recycled paper paper like he did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing her work that particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and he said, "We're going to be okay.
Let's be okay."
Shortly after that, I began to investigate waste collection and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> We worked together so many times and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
Let's be fine.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we need to include and have to account for all the costs, even the very real human cost of the labor.
The municipal waste is what we think of when we talk about garbage, they represent three percent of the waste waste.
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of your days and your lives, the next one you see somebody whose work is to clean the garbage out of you, <unk> a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work is focused on the connection to thinking about our community life, forming part of the environment where architecture is naturally born from conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
In addition to they share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives into an essential part of the work of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a mall in a number of floors in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis <unk>
This is the kind of building that showed us as an example of my team and me, about what we had to design.
At the beginning, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go <unk>
And after seeing some of these buildings there are many of these buildings in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because the lining of crystals generates heat into the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it's about a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees across the year.
And thirdly, his aspect has nothing to do with Africa and with Ethiopia.
It's a big time for a very rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really <unk> with the old market that is this structure in the open air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought that was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a building, of several stories, by applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the site, the site, which is located in a lot of a lot of growth in the city, where much of the buildings that we see in the image, not yet.
And it's also between two streets parallel that they don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was create a connection between these two streets, putting all the entries in the building.
And this spreads with an <unk> <unk> which creates a space in the open air in the building that gets eaten by its own shape of the sun and the rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, that changes on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
And I wanted to find a solution that we would bring to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a fabric that was similar to a concrete shell.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons from the dresses of the <unk>
They have the properties of fractal geometry and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that let rise to the air and light in a way controlled by the inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little colored crystals that use light inside the building to illuminate the building at night.
So with these ideas it wasn't really easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center -- it wasn't what you get.
But ultimately we all realized that this idea of the market was going to be much more profitable than the mall because at the end of the bank there was more local to sell.
And also the idea of the facade was much more economic -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but because it was no longer necessary to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to get the energy <unk> for the building in a city in which electricity is cut almost every day.
So we got a great advantage to putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this urban oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, which together collect water for the <unk>
It's expected for the early year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a teacher of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a project that is so big, the biggest thing I have designed -- I needed to not just understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis I got special attention in the <unk> a <unk> structure of ancient <unk> that was surrounded by a <unk> wall of access to near straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was extend the streets and create 12 similar blocks in size and features that are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some <unk> points in relation to the idea of interconnected doors with straight lines, and this changes the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the little cell on the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would the best guidance look for an apartment in the <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So we <unk> a scheme that claims most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result of almost a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then on the plant, you have all the connections for pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that set up more density at higher levels and lower density in the low plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving back to the community the space occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, can come up and go up and do activities like running a <unk> race in the morning, or jump from a building to the other.
These two examples, have a common focus on the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in life is changing communities and local economies at the same pace growing buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have to connect nature to the people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had huge amounts of hair, very bright hair, and a little bit of <unk> <unk> was super strong for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of <unk> until I had my sinister plan.
I was a time after I got out of school, I was a little afternoon and she was stuck in the <unk>
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took the book from my master's book.
And then, I did.
I took the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just some case.
All like this.  And I set out to bring the book back to the <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> I would tell the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put them to all of the rows of <unk> and myself a row of that, just because I was there.
I'm still surprising to what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt good at it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It was that everything was <unk>
I would never tell you.
But above all, I would tell you the reason I bothered me that this little little little little little girl was so small to <unk>
I <unk> the jealousy.
They are so mysterious and so <unk>
We know babies suffer from jealousy.
Also, the primates. The birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of <unk> in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that to look at loneliness, or long length or sadness.
So you have to go to fiction, because the novels are like the lab that we study <unk> in all their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there were no <unk> I would have no literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> no <unk>
There was no king <unk> or <unk> and a <unk>
There would be no Shakespeare.
I had the secondary school lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
No <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the <unk> almost that you have all of them.
This year, 100 years of his masterpiece, "In the <unk> of the time <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the <unk> <unk> my God, everything we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details of <unk> right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image is.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, this is books that Virginia <unk> said were as hard as <unk> of cat.
I don't know how the cat, the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It will be very obvious as the <unk> that are reduced to the person, their desire, to their <unk> are a narrative <unk>
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel bad.
Being in the storytellers and the audience, we know exactly what details to do to put the knife -- right?
The <unk> do all of all novelists <unk> and that's something I understood understood.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure it could give me pleasure from the other, maybe right now."
And it starts to say that story, and since then, <unk> says that every charm fresh that <unk> detects in his lover -- he adds it to his collection of <unk> instruments in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break up with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion <unk> You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> like the big amounts of hair, and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> came from the photos.
That's why that Instagram is as successful --  -- <unk> links out language <unk> with the jealousy.
When you <unk> it is in his <unk> agony of <unk> you would suddenly hear behind the door to the <unk> to the <unk> of his lover -- then it defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different than an old text or watching a <unk>
He says, "They're scientific research with real value <unk>
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> you see <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they're finding knowledge, pursuit of the truth, a really painful truth -- in fact, what we would expect, the more painful the truth, the better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> these were the pathways going towards the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need to do, that makes us experience that causes us to make a range of much more profound and vital feelings than a wise man who can tell us.
It's telling us that we're going to look for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> will reveal ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us open in this particular way.
Is there any other emotion to us, our horrific ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at intensity so <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a young young man who was being used to the idea that her woman was doing it.
And Freud said that there was something weird in that man, which is not <unk> in what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that made his wife, without realizing it.
<unk> <unk> or also accidentally accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
<unk> describe very well how the <unk> make us look at intensity but not accurately.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, the more we become a fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to do violent and illegal acts for this.
<unk> drive us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me for the age of eight years, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
One woman of Michigan of 52 years old was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook since the one that was shipped up with horrible messages to itself, awful for one year.
For one year, every year.
She was trying to send me to my new girlfriend of his former boyfriend. And I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with awe.
Because, let's be realistic.
How big -- although <unk> creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a <unk> <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and bright character from the American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that try to make our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of <unk> the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want to want what you have to do with your self and get away from what some time <unk> and he's under the ground -- and it's under the floor. <unk> your <unk> <unk> your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't tell you all the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in the time of jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social networks, where the coin is <unk> right?
The novels show us <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what characters always do when they're not sure, when they are in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always got <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> <unk> <unk> that needs <unk> <unk> needs the genius of <unk> but <unk>
Oh, I was so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but we would take it up with <unk> in each of those puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> once you <unk> <unk> <unk> to all of its solution, <unk> goes back to <unk> and he says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he says there is no person in <unk> <unk> who wouldn't want to hold your hand.
It's one of the few times that we see <unk> transferred in history. I think this is very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a geometry, no emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute you are the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> is allowed to admire that idea of being the <unk>
Could it even be so <unk>
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to get rid of the excellence of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that happens, let's remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
Only <unk> fiction, jealousy.
The fiction alone invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> <unk> <unk> the scary Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the <unk>
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On the 21st of July 1969, Buzz Aldrin went out of the left module.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but their presence in the surface in the surface of the surface was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest mobilization.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo took work to 400,000 people and asked 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
And people died, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked on top of the surface, which Aldrin came out after Armstrong was last year, is now the most <unk>
So why would you care?
They didn't have a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that the 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some ask, why do we <unk>
Why turn it into our goal?
And you might ask, why scale the most <unk>
35 years ago, why fly about <unk>
Why does it play <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
And we chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo was not just a victory of the West about this in the Cold War.
In the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> to the transcendence of the powers of technology.
They were because it was something great to do it.
The landing on the moon occurred in a context of a long list of technological <unk>
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line, and the plane, penicillin and vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> the <unk> and we eliminated the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship with candle -- but in 1969, the <unk> crew <unk> flew for 40,000 miles / hour.
From 1970, no human being has become the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the joy of optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that the problems we imagine that technology would solve as going to Mars, create a clean energy, to cure the cancer, or to feed the world population, seem to have a result of it.
I remember the <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't get to the escape tube <unk> from the rocket named Saturn <unk>
I knew so much that this would be the ultimate mission -- but I was completely sure that I would get to see the colonies on Mars.
So that assumptions happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard that for the two last days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologists would have met us, and they would have been enriched trivial toys, things like <unk> apps and social media, or algorithms that speed up.
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've extended and enriched our lives.
But we don't appreciate the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is a <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have created less ambitious companies that are <unk> in the years that they were <unk> Intel and Apple and Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, specifically incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk triggered the creation of <unk> ideas for funding problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It's mostly going wrong with <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were in their high point without worrying about the risk, they preferred small investment investments case that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital to invest in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital of the development of technologies intended to solve big problems because they don't have a commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we chose to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular, and that's never going to happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption comes from sources of renewables like solar and wind and <unk> less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy that can compete for price don't exist.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and international treaties -- development of energy <unk> <unk> a significant increase in research and development, and some kind of cost of coal.
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we're going to see an energy policy in America or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seem technological, they turn out not to be.
We know from time that famines are a result of failure in the <unk>
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are the political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like harvest or systems for storage and food connection, but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The president of President Nixon was declared to cancer in 1971, but soon we found that there are many kinds of cancer, some <unk> <unk> -- and only in the last 10 years, seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
<unk> problems are difficult.
It's not true that we can't solve the problems with technology.
We can be able to do it, but these four elements have been <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to be able to fix the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> must be really a problem that is <unk> and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve great problems, true with those <unk>
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no competition -- like in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> how hard and dangerous, and there's no matter of science fiction like we explore the solar system.
In general, go to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> <unk> ideas that have about confidence.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there has been a very widespread decline of trust, is a very widespread fear.
The second is a goal: we should have more confidence.
And the third one is a <unk> we should regain confidence.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a target and task that I think gives you a more clear idea about the subject.
First <unk> why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
It turns me to think that there may be dropped in some cases or institutions and that might have increased in others.
I don't have it.
But I can go to opinion surveys and opinion polls are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at opinion polls over time, there's no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were being asked about 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, follow <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years are still quite <unk> when nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost half the way.
But is this <unk>
What the opinion polls are recorded are, of course, opinions.
What else can you get?
What you see is the generic attitudes that people believe when they do certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody said to you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
You probably hate for asking, "What what?"
And that would be a very sensible answer.
And you could say, when you answered your question, "Well, I trust you in some other not."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust in <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust we're going to feel like a certain type of <unk> official or a person, going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, saying I trust a certain elementary teacher that I know to give you the kind of reading, but in no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my <unk> <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk>
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they try to make it <unk> the inherent judgment of the fact of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more confidence.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It's not that point that I <unk>
I would encourage you to have more confidence in what it is to trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm a <unk> of not trusting what it's not reliable.
And I think that those people who would take their savings with the very rightly called Mr. Madoff, who then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, yeah, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right goal.
Once you say, it says, yes, that means that what matters first is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about to do a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that we can make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is competent in <unk> and it's responsible for and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust her, because it's going to be worthy of confidence.
But if, on the contrary, they are not responsible for us to not trust them.
I have friends who are competent and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that they would take their own <unk>
And I'm very happy to say that I don't have many friends that are competent and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like that, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're doing, let's go ahead and before they trust.
Trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we have to <unk>
And of course, it's difficult.
Over the last few decades, we have tried to build systems of accountability for all sorts of kinds of professional professionals, officials and others, that made us easier for us to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once she was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you see the problem is it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> that will be in <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we have <unk> that the accountability system that's meant to ensure the <unk> and the testing of <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that we are <unk> as we say.
I'm sure all of you have similar examples.
And I mean, all of that, for the goal.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we were trying to be worthy of being worthy of trust, and they will give people to people who are reliable and if you try to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of confidence.
It's not easy. It's the trial, simple actions.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to rebuild the trust, puts things around.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve confidence.
But the confidence ultimately is defining because they give us a lot of other people.
You can't rebuild what other people have ever given.
You have to give them enough to be able to trust you.
You have to be worthy of confidence.
And that, of course, is because you can't get <unk> by the general people, all the time.
But you also have to contribute evidence that you're worthy of confidence.
How do you do that?
That makes a day, everywhere, it makes the common people, the common people, <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks says I can get them out without giving them <unk>
I carry them and return me and make it change by the color that I want.
That's great. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have trust in what you're saying.
So, at the end, I think that what we're pointing at is not very hard to <unk>
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how other person is worthy of confidence.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we have been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen where the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone increasingly increasingly and more and more, at a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of the glass screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if there was no <unk>
I started imagining how it would be.
First of us created this tool that goes into the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers its physical body to <unk>
The designers can prescribe their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice a virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool you break down the barriers.
But the two hands remain still out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the whole dexterity of your hands?
In the <unk> Science <unk> of Microsoft, along with my mentor.
They <unk> a transparent hand with depth cameras to detect the fingers and the face, you can now lift the hands of the keyboard, get inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like the windows and archives have a location in real space, <unk> is as easy as to grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and highlight the lines or the words with the virtual touch sensor that there is on each floating screen.
The architects can stretch or to rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the roles and we make digital information come towards us?
<unk> many of us would have bought and put things out on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual array of Internet online.
This is the vision that you get from a device mounted on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make it physicists so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future look like?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor and Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical pixel.
This evolutionary magnet, is behaving like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as the users can move the object anywhere in this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And by programming digitally the object, we released it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can be <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach physically and physically and the famous result of Michael Jordan can be reproduce as a physical reality that we want to.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and, unlike monitors or textbooks -- this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what's more fascinating than to change the physics of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities our everyday activities.
As you can see, digital information not just to show us something but begin to act directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without us that we have to save our world.
We started talking today about a barrier, but if you take that barrier, the only limit that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was excited to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk>
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to take a school for athletes to athletes all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After they survive the Islamic Revolution, they firmly believed that there was only an effective way towards <unk> a safe and good job.
No matter whether the work I'd like or not.
But my dream was to be an opera singer in Chinese opera.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer should start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio show.
But no adult would tell you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So the age of 15, I knew that it was too much more to train.
My dream is never <unk>
I realized that during the rest of my life a second class happiness was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one to me around me wanted to <unk> OK.
Tell the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I came to the United States in 1995, and what the first books were going to do here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese <unk>
And it's not propaganda a <unk> convenience.
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I told me, "It's so different, and so much better than he <unk>
So it became my tool for me to get out of this trap <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
I find it with a new culture too, and it also gave me a place to my reading habit.
We had a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map seemed to me out of place because this is what the students in China learn.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves people's perspective.
Real reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to research fields as a comparative religion and academic <unk>
<unk> and <unk> offers the academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if reading comparative work worked for research, why not do it in everyday life?
So I started reading books from two.
It can be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For Christ, <unk> are economic and <unk>
For Buddha, it's all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> needed.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> on the <unk> Alan <unk> <unk> <unk>
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> basically means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magic door to meet people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to go back to myself or powerless ever.
Having a <unk> dream is really not anything compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that I'm not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, where the passion comes from, where happiness.
Until a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client of <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman called <unk>
Alex walked into the first session using jeans and a encountered <unk> threw on my office couch, took my shoes off, and he told me she wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My class had a <unk> as a first client.
And I was a <unk> that I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the sessions, it became easy to just move your head while to get the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> saying, Alex, and so I saw her, she was right.
You start working on, and you start to go home later, you have kids later, until death goes on.
For <unk> like Alex and I had been <unk>
But soon after, my <unk> pushed me down to <unk> Alex talking about his life <unk>
I was shocked.
I said, "Sure, are coming up with guys under his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my squad <unk> said, "No no, but maybe he <unk> over the next.
In addition, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people sit up after what they were like, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex to be a <unk>
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment and we were <unk>
And so I realized that this kind of haphazard recklessness was a real problem and had real consequences not only for Alex and loving life, but for careers, families and future <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of population, or 100 percent if you think no one comes to adulthood without going through the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! It's amazing.
If they work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take away the dream -- a <unk> I want to see. It's right. <unk> really matter.
This is not just my opinion. This is the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will spend 35 years.
This means that eight of each 10 decisions and experiences and moments that give you a way to your life you've got to have past 30 and <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half the Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their own couple for 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in its <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there is something that you want to change yourself, it's now the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time in life, and we know that female fertility comes to the top 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the moment to <unk> on their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment where your everyday life and common has an impact on the person who is <unk>
But what we don't hear often is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in the adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of adulthood.
The researchers call the <unk> a <unk> adolescence
<unk> <unk> names of the <unk> like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines adulthood.
Leonard <unk> said to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it true?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and say, "You get another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person to the sense of urgency and his ambition and it is absolutely nothing.
And then every day, <unk> clever people like you or their children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend, who is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't count, I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody said that while I start a career before the 30, everything is okay."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better copy the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts sounding something like this: "My quotes for the <unk> were like the game game.
And they were all running and <unk> but then at some point around the 30, the music turned out, and they all started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who was standing, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit end, but you don't know the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things to <unk> there's a huge pressure on the ages of 30 and so many of you will start a career, choose a city, choosing a mate, and have two or three children in a much shortest period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there's research that starts to show, which is much harder and stressful to do everything from once to <unk>
The middle-aged crisis is not about buying red cars or red fields.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
You realize you can't have the son you want to do now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> look at themselves, and I was sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What were you doing? What was he thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
By 25, Emma came to my office because I was, in his own words, having an identity crisis.
He said I'd like to work in art or in the entertainment, but I still couldn't decide, so the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And even though I live in a very difficult <unk> his previous life had been even more difficult.
<unk> often in our sessions, but then you wake up to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and cried for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent the whole morning <unk> with his many <unk> but then he looked at the empty space that follows after the words of the words <unk> please call <unk>
He was about the <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who's going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of if it gives me <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of job to resist and not say, <unk>
And what Emma needed was not a <unk> that was really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit in while the <unk> decade of Emma passed on.
So, for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma that <unk> of that crisis of identity and <unk> identity.
For identity, I mean to do something that add value to its person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and no one knows the future of work, but I do know this: social capital generates identity.
So now it's the time for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try it out.
I am not <unk> exploration, <unk> and exploration that shouldn't count, which, by the way, is not exploration, which is by the way.
It's <unk>
I said to Emma who would explore jobs and make them count.
Second, I told Emma the urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with similar minds just to who you know about, how do you think, how they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital -- that new person who is going to come out almost always comes from his nearest circle.
The new things come from what they call the weak ties friends of their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or don't have a job.
But the other half no, and the weak bonds are the way to get it into this group.
Half the jobs created never <unk> then, knowing the head of your neighbor is the way to get a job of not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is going on.
Last but not least, Emma believed that you don't pick your family, but I know her friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but like <unk> Emma soon <unk> her family when she has a partner and there is his own family.
I told Emma that time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better enough to sit than 20 or even 25 and even 25 and I agree with you.
But choosing to the person that you live now or let you go now when everybody on Facebook start to walk towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you do, and that implies being as intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just making it work or killing time with whoever we <unk> to you.
So what happened with <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate in a <unk> working in a <unk> museum in another state.
This weak bond helped her get a job in there.
That work supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, who alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special from events in museums.
This married man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves her new family, and I sent a letter that said, "Now the emergency spaces of emergency room are not <unk>
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love about working with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
The <unk> are like planes coming out of Los Angeles, who come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a light fits in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at the age of 21, or the 25 and even <unk> a good deal, a good <unk> a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the years or even in the next generation.
Here is my idea that is worth spreading to all the <unk>
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
It's what I now have the privilege of telling <unk> like Emma all the <unk> <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get identity, use their weak links -- pick your family.
They don't even define what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They are deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> job in <unk> <unk> for a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach students from seventh grade in public schools in New York City.
And like any professor, I made tests and tests.
I give them tasks.
When I work back, we will get grades.
What struck me was that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better judge didn't have scores of <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest children weren't going to be so good.
And that got me thinking.
The kinds of things that you need to learn in seventh grade grade are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during time.
After several years later, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure how to measure it.
It's the <unk> but what happens if you succeed in school and in life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and that easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> and every study was, who is successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> West <unk>
And we tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training.
We went to the National <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what children would do as far as possible in competition.
We studied <unk> teachers working in really difficult neighborhoods -- to figure out what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school and <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the learning outcome of their <unk>
Do we associate with private companies, ask, what from these marketers are going to keep their job <unk>
Who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, arose a feature as an important success <unk>
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and it wasn't <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and perseverance to achieve long-term goals.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to their future, day after day, not only for the month, but for years and working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a race at all.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to do determination and then waited about a year to see those who <unk>
It turns out that the kids with more determination had significantly greater likely to graduation, even when they were <unk> in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the evidence -- even the safety they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National <unk> of <unk> in which <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, what's most shocking about determination is how little we know, how little of science knows about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do we develop purpose in children?
What should I do to teach kids a robust job ethic.
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The more honest answer is: I don't know.  What I know is that the talent doesn't give you purpose.
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the determining commonly related or is related to inversely to talented questions.
So far, the best idea I've been hearing about developing children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University, for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, of which it can change with effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it grows in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the mindset of growth is a great idea to develop purpose.
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go on.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure if they've been successful, and we have to be willing to fail, to fail, to start all again with the lessons <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as a daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> <unk> is my mother, the way that the Chinese shape and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that time, I was overwhelmed by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great <unk> China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so anyone who might want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new and quick method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than let's do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic society.
The first 200 will allow them to understand 40 percent of the basic literature -- enough to read signals from traffic menus to understand the basic idea of the web or the newspapers.
Today I will start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as possible until it is <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a ride.
<unk>
If the fire form is a person with arms on both sides, as if it was shouting in a <unk> <unk> I am <unk> This is actually <unk> in the form of the flame -- but I like to believe it is the other way. It will work.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The door of the door looks like a couple of doors of <unk> in the old West.
I call these eight characters.
They're building blocks to make a lot more characters.
One person.
If somebody walks back, that's <unk>
As the old one, two are a company company, three are crowd.
If one person risked your arms, this person is saying, <unk> this great thing.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> as a <unk> in the whale.
A tree is a tree, two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
You put a chart under the tree, we have the foundations of foundation.
You put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>   So let's remember, because a official tree is quite an idiot.
Do you remember the <unk>
Two step together, it gets very hot.
Three together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the <unk>
One door. You put a board inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> played there at home?
This person is coming up hidden from one gate, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, be <unk>
So we've already spent nearly 30 characters.
By using this approach, the first eight radical <unk> will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with each small effort, you will be able to learn a couple hundreds of characters, which is the same thing you learn a Chinese eight years.
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know Japan is the Earth of the sun <unk>
This is a sun put up with the beginning, because Japan is east of China.
So a sun next to the beginning, create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked on the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become a date.
A mouth that tells you where to go out is a exit.
This is a slide for remind you that I should stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the Oz of Oz together.
The film came, his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave a good excuse to use a bright dress and bring a magic wand of it.
But when you see that film as many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live in and bring our children into a sort of an industrial complex kind of new <unk>
But the magician.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took 40 years later, later with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> a metal kid and a guy named <unk> <unk> a girl dressed as a guard of the enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?  Yes.
There's a big difference between these two movies, there's a couple of great differences between the magician of the Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, as the <unk>
But I think that if the Oz of Oz will do today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
<unk> shoes to defeat the hostile armies from the evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the <unk> of the Oz is that the more <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I began to notice this when I did see "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At the time, I had a son at the time.
In only three years.
He wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance was <unk>  And so she was slid in the room and he was impressed by the room, and he was impressed by the room behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would it be topics of value, resilience and <unk>
Do I feel like Luke get a military to <unk> government?
<unk> this with the Oz of <unk>
How does he make Dorothy your movie?
Let's do good <unk> with everyone and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my children to grow up, to grow up, okay? And not a world of men that <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there as much effective capital force, force in movies for our children, and so little on the path of building <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know by experience that the Princess <unk> doesn't give me the right frame that would have served to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the time of the first <unk> I really expected the credit to come up because it's the end of the film, right?
My search has finished, I have a girlfriend.
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
<unk> are focused on defeat <unk> and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are many exceptions, and to defend the Disney of Disney before any of you.
But they send a message to kids, even though they, they are not really their target audience.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend them against <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend themselves from <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, so real and <unk> as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful issue of all times is still appearing in classic <unk> classic every one of them about the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who raised a little girl.
So, as many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out of it.
I recommend all of you, it's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism was when he came up with?
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies passes the test test.
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not rooted in and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book book and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had a friend about the assessment of the movies you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions you have to <unk> in the film, there is more than a female character who has <unk>
So you have to get the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something more than the kid you like it?  Right? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet I rarely see it in the film that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success, a consensus idea of what is a Hollywood Hollywood film.
<unk> doesn't happen the test of <unk>
And I don't think <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of film happens in a embassy where men and women hide during the crisis of the <unk>
We have a lot of scenes of men that have profound and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the players to take a look at the door and say, "Let's go to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So it was <unk> in the numbers.
In 2011, from the 100 most popular movies, how many of them think they have protagonists <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percent that the number of women that we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's okay.
But there is a larger number that this is going to take care of this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said.
In the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually assaulted in your life.
I don't think it's a mass entertainment.
I don't think that movies for children have something to do with that.
I also don't think that music videos or pornography are closely aligned, but something goes wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things that I think is there is a huge amount of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do you do not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then charge reward, which is a woman who doesn't have friends and not <unk>
We're getting that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very alarming statistic and we want to be able to <unk>
We have tools to our disposal as <unk> <unk> and we hope that we have to ask, <unk> <unk> going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their own power to keep their power.
I mean, I think the list of Netflix is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly the parents.
I think we have to show our male kids a new definition of <unk>
The definition of <unk> is radically changing.
You have read about how the new economy is changing the role that you look after the home and the <unk>
Everything is changing.
And when I asked my daughter what was his favorite Star character of "Star <unk> You know what I <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just brilliant.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them to achieve their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories to my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want fewer stories in which I tell my <unk> Go and go and fight only and more stories where his job is to join a team -- maybe a team led by women, helping other people improve and to be better people, like the <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine, and one of the things that I liked most like it was to look at sea cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered with sand and it's hard to see them.
However, for the time, I got to <unk>
I started looking at ways and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in love for the past and the <unk>
And finally, when I started studying <unk> I realized that I see with my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of almost 1.3 miles of length along the <unk>
And my sea cookies had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see in a different way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we use the <unk>
This is a place located in the east Delta of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, in the naked eye, it seems to be brown but when we use infrared and we process it using fake, suddenly the place looks like bright pink <unk>
What you're seeing is the real chemical changes of the landscape of the landscape of the <unk> and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find an ancient city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the old Egypt of the old Egypt for over 400 years in a time period called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire, there was this great renaissance of the ancient art of art, architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge continuous <unk>
This area is huge -- it measures approximately <unk> per mile.
Before, <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, it moved to this and covered the whole city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
And I'll try and try it to find the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with your eyes, and using baseball <unk>
So, we use NASA <unk> to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interestingly, this slightly elevated area that looks inside the circle here, which we thought might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with the Egyptians doing <unk> and they can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of it shows up on ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human occupation of human occupation, looking for us.
Five feet down, underneath a thick layer of mud, we found a dense layer of <unk>
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a layer of occupation several hundred years ago that date back from the Middle Empire.
We also found <unk> jobs and quartz and <unk> what shows that there was a workshop of <unk> there.
This might seem like it's not too much, but when we think about the most common stones used at the jewelry, in the Ottoman Empire -- these are the rocks that are <unk>
So, we have a dense layer of occupation of occupation of the Middle Empire.
We also have evidence of an elite <unk> shop that proves that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still haven't found <unk> here, but let's go to the place in a near future to <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire.
To share the knowledge is the biggest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So according to TED I was not founded in 1984 to give C.
So the ideas were really started in 1984 B.C. C in a lost city not for a long time and found from the top.
It certainly puts the search of shells in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk> home.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, to the material that he's made of.
Now <unk> a group of obese people on bikes.
They are competing on a domestic <unk> race and they go into the front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide against the door of their house.
There's bicycles flying around the parts, and they go on the side of the wheels that end up in the <unk> places -- <unk> the line.
And in the lobby, in the hall, or the other side of the door, and you see the quality of the light, and the light is shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
They're waving with your hand.
From his chair on a brown horse.
It's a horse that speech.
They can feel its blue <unk> by <unk> on your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you think it's about to get into the mouth.
<unk> on a side and enter their living room.
So in the room, and making maximum use of his imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothing, dancing over their center, <unk> singing <unk> A More <unk>
Now let's go to the kitchen.
The soil has been coated with a yellow bricks path and from the oven come to you -- the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> of the hands, <unk> towards you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
So I want to tell you about a particular competition that has done every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, waiting, I guess, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ladies and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- <unk> just once.
They put the names of dozens and dozens of strangers.
We provide whole poems in just minute.
He had to see who he could memorize the <unk> the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people must be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and has one of the best <unk>
I said, "Well, when did you realize you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have a average memory.
Everybody who participate in this competition says they have normal memory.
"We have trained to do these miraculous acts of memory using some old techniques, invented a half thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques that he used to <unk> to memorize their <unk> and that the medieval academics used to memorize books <unk>
And my reaction was, "How did I have not heard of this <unk>
We were standing out of the hall of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English English man, but a little bit <unk> said to me, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to show Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of <unk> live on national TV.
That would prove to the world that anyone can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
So you might have to start by something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up spending most of the next year, not just training my memory, but also trying to understand how it works, why it doesn't work and what its potential will be.
I met a bunch of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He is <unk> very likely to the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that he had a problem with <unk> it's awesome.
Somebody incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows to see how much our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this guy.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the paper of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We went back in the public library in the back of Salt Lake City, <unk> guides -- was <unk>
And in return, I read a number of treaties on memory written about 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time where this idea of having a disciplined and disciplined and diverse memory was not such a rare thing as you can find today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but they also have changed.
They have changed <unk> and I would say that they have changed as well.
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes we seem to have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find passionate about this idea of a joint and disciplined memory is this genetic competition of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> there is the skills like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College College invited a group of memory champions to lab.
They wanted to know, "It will have brains in some form of structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they smarter than <unk>
They gave them a <unk> test battery.
There was yet a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of the memory champions and the subjects of control that the <unk>
When they put them into a <unk> MRI machine, they would look at their brains while they were <unk> numbers, faces and shapes of the snow. They found that in memory champions are spreading parts of the brain, different to each other.
They actually <unk> or seemed like <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
Why? There is something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> competitive is driving as an armed career where every year appears to be a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors have to get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times <unk> memory.
On his desk, in front of him, there is 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> who he's about to try to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and he just <unk>
He used a technique similar to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits and <unk>
<unk>
And while there is a huge amount of ways to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques that are used at the end of the end is reduced to one concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates that with a elegant paradox known as the Copernican paradox: <unk> it says this: I'm saying to two people who remember the same word. I'm saying to you -- there's a man called <unk>
That's his name.
And then I ask you, <unk> that there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them <unk> that word I told you about a <unk>
So let me tell you what <unk>
The person who told him that his name is <unk> is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told to be told that their work is <unk>
The same word, different <unk> capacity -- that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, it doesn't really mean nothing for you. There's no relationship anymore.
with all the other memories that dance on their head.
But the word <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have <unk>
They spend good when they go back home to work.
Would you probably remember some <unk>
And when you go through that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some time later.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this again half a thousand years ago in the Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> who went to a <unk>
They had been hired as a entertainment, because before, if he wanted to give a very good party, you didn't bring to a <unk> <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up <unk> his memory poem -- and it was <unk> and so soon it was, the hall of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> all of us.
But not just the killed all of them, but it shattered the bodies of <unk>
No one could say who was there, no one could remember where they were sitting there.
So you could not get the <unk>
One tragedy behind the other.
He stopped standing outside in the middle of the rubble, closed my eyes and realized that with his eyes in his mind, I could see where I had been sitting every single <unk>
I took her to the <unk> hand where they were their loved ones in the rubble.
What we <unk> we've noticed at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is no matter whether we're not good at remembering names or numbers of the phone or instructions and instructions by the word of our colleagues, we have visual and spatial memory.
If you let me tell you that the first 10 words of the story I just told you about <unk> is very likely to be very difficult to do it.
But I bet I would bet that if you tell them to say who was sitting on the horse -- brown speaker in his <unk> would be able to be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with your head of mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want to remember the most crazy -- the most crazy -- the one picture, which is the most <unk>
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first treaties of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to make it memory, the same way that I would have done it -- if you had invited him to <unk> it was 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine that they're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some sort of absolutely ridiculous, crazy and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing they want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine moving into your house, and seeing the <unk> of the <unk> mounted on <unk>
And that will remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then they entered the kitchen, and the fourth subject that they would talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
This is how the speakers <unk> <unk> their <unk> not word by word, that the ones are going to confuse you, it's typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a remnant of when people thought about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of space terms.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in his palazzo of memory.
I saw that this was just a fascinating thing, and I got in full of with that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something big about this <unk> of competitive <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a boring event.
Really, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting by taking exams. I mean, the most exciting thing happens is when someone <unk> the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access to.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in his place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes all the <unk> before I sit at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient School bought in a market of <unk>
And I discovered that this was entertaining.
I would never have expected it to be.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training the memory.
What is actually about doing is to make it better and more the ability to create and imagine these images by <unk> I was writing <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was pretty excited about this.
This is me, using my standard standard training team for memory.
It's a couple of <unk> and a pair of safety covered with tape leaving only two <unk> because the distraction.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that he had covered a year before. He had the idea that I could sort of <unk> in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could serve for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
And of course, it's nice to memorize <unk> and phone numbers on the phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just so just <unk> <unk> that work.
Because it's based on very basic principles of how the brain works.
And you don't need to put them out of the memory of memory or memorize a little bit of <unk> to benefit from a little bit of <unk> about how their mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was about a <unk> but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
We focus on the way we focus deep in.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques, are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing sort of <unk> kind of attention that most is <unk> around there.
But the reality is that there is no shortcuts.
This is how things become <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today is what the <unk> I could not even remember it had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our short <unk> existence in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks around our side to be so <unk> that we don't even engage in processing in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you should be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, and so it will be <unk> just a <unk> place New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from expressing Jersey, I was six years old, I lived there in my parents' home in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the toilet, there was a balcony that I gave the living room.
And there were all the time I looked at my television -- so every time I was going from my room to the bathroom, everybody looked at me -- and every time I would go back and come back up in a towel -- everybody was seen.
And I was like this.
It was foolish to breathe and hated it.
I had that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about math -- because architecture is not about <unk> but of those connections, emotional connections that we feel in the places that we have.
And it's not surprising that we feel like that, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we're surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture determines us in ways that we don't even realize it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you think about, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know what it is because they think that in a building built a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that uses architects to create an emotional connection to the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional <unk> we have used this trick for a long, long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build museums in art.
And in the 20th century, we used it to build houses.
Look, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
People who are doing the <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that you know are going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Library of <unk> which was ended in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a <unk> has this round thing, a little bit of red <unk> that leave <unk> what <unk> tries to communicate with this <unk> children, the values of the property, the story.
But it doesn't have much to do with a library today.
That same year in 2004, in 2004, the other side of the country, ended up another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use communication in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works as the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects that are constantly driving new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for life forms today.
We went back and we kind of <unk> so much, that we get away from the people.
And all of the black, this is -- you think we feel very well, but we are dead in it because we don't have another option.
We need to go to the other side and come back to connect with those symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we are all like <unk> So we started to experience <unk> so we swing the back back and over and over and over again. So we've done this over the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago in the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small, <unk> scale.
Very hard.
So we get closer to the 1980s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
We would bring the pendulum back in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that we like and <unk>
You know, <unk> and we add a bake and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We take <unk> <unk> and turn them into skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk> <unk>
The shapes <unk> won in boldness and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
<unk>
But they were the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend the time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there, in the suburbs, we can create our own <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to French or Italian.
Maybe with a number of <unk> of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens to symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we can also collaborate out memories of other places.
I know very well, and all of you know, this is not <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started to swing the pendulum back in the other direction.
In the 1980s, and in the early '90s, we started experimenting with so-called <unk>
We have <unk> the symbols -- we now have new design techniques that we have new design techniques and we found ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that are <unk> against other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You have totally <unk>
Typically, the <unk> <unk> back in the opposite direction.
But then, something happened.
In 1997, the opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical academic and public critical in general they were completely aware of a building.
The New York Times <unk> this <unk> construction newspaper.
The tourism in Bilbao grew up in a 2,500 percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these wild and radical forms, how is it possible to become ubiquitous across the world?
And it happened, because the media was <unk> around them, and we quickly learned that those forms that were meant and peaceful and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The same did the biggest mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon in the beginning of the new millennia.
And I went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium, actually started going through the whole architecture.
You think, for example, how do you consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, I would have to have to have walked up to the next village to see a building.
The transport is <unk> you can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we are all photographers of architecture, and the building is transported beyond their physical shape.
The architecture is everywhere right now means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so quickly.
It's not a lot of time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings more than knowing if the one that I designed four years ago was successful or not.
Because there's never been a good feedback in architecture.
That's how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much <unk>
That's never going to happen to happen, because we are at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the steel or <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to media, it starts to swing faster and faster, until it will be on both extremes in <unk> and they will actually become the difference between innovation.
Now we can do almost <unk> symbols with emotional charge of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that is <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> on <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building was finished the building, it was part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly at the product over, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people started to get and share it in social media, the building stopped being just a building, it became a media, because these are not just images of a building, it's the images that you made from the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and by carrying these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media not only have changed the relationship between us, but they have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building builds up today, first <unk> to the Internet for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of experiment, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell them that there's no answer to what a library can be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
The architects are already not those mysterious creatures that use words <unk> and complicated, and one is not a <unk> audience, which is not accepting something that hasn't seen before.
So architects can listen, and one is not allowed by architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> of one style to another movement is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
That means that an public space in the former city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of red brick in the basis of the very ideas that it should be a <unk>
That means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we eventually will be ready for the ways that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings <unk> to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a garage garage garage in Miami also can serve to make sport or <unk> or even you can marry them at night.
This means that three architects can dream of swimming on the East <unk> of New York, and to raise half a million dollars of the living community around that cause, it's no longer a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> as the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what matters is what we build.
The architects already know how to make more <unk> more <unk> smarter and more friendly.
We've been waiting for all of you to want.
Finally, we're not on the opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> and work together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot in play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give way to the most local spaces in local libraries the homes where we formed our children, and the step of the bedroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and he started walking.
And it makes it really very typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that most of the most likes to do for the moment is <unk> in the mirror.
She really loves her reflection.
<unk> and <unk> and it gives themselves those big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and he made me think, "When you stop doing this?
How do we suddenly are not happy with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for Google "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old, and it lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just want to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because even though his mom says all the time it is beautiful, every day in school, someone says it's ugly.
Among what his mom says and what her friends, or the school of the school you say, doesn't know who to believe.
So a video of it does a video of her, publishes it on YouTube, and he wants others to please please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm a <unk>
Well, so far, <unk> has received over 13,000 comment.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a healthy teenager, a normal time that gets these answers on one of the most vulnerable and vulnerable lives.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, in their most teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it doing this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking about it: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
We never have been so connected, in a continuous way, so young as so young.
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in his room all the <unk>
There is simply no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment of being always connected -- it's <unk> to our children to <unk> based on the number of people like that they have and the kinds of comments that they do.
There's no divide between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it's not.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what's authentic and what is being rigged <unk>
What is the best in people's life in front of someone who is normal in a <unk> context.
And where are they looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are cover from the girls now.
<unk> zero continues to dominate our <unk>
The <unk> technique is now a routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> it <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what the young young people are.
But kids are not immune to this.
It's like the superheroes of sports, and the singers and the singers <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we probably want our children to grow healthy and be individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, to the price of all the other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other aspects start to suffer.
Six out of 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for growth as human beings, and as human beings to society and the developing field.
<unk> -- almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the classroom, <unk> participate in the classroom <unk> because they don't want to call attention for their physical <unk>
One in five are not <unk> at all the time when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the test season, if you don't think that you look good enough -- specifically if you don't think you're enough enough, you get a smaller note to the average of your companions who don't care about that appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, United States and China.
And it turns out regardless of what these young people are.
So, to be clear, of course, we're talking about you how you see it, not what you're like.
The low self-esteem on your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-worth doing less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, they participate in more diet -- not healthy they can take them into a food disorder that they can take for food.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around the surrounding people and they're at greater risk of depression.
And we think it's all about this because of what they make more <unk> decisions like alcohol and drugs, diet <unk> aesthetic surgery, <unk> sexual relations and no protection and damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing into the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they're overweight again, regardless of whether or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
Fifty percent of women are not presented to a job interview in a day that they don't secure with the way you can see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that <unk>
<unk> this potential is interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, by itself, it doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key ways. The first one is that we need to nurture their own body.
We need to help our teenagers to develop strategies to get through the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we have to make sure that the program that our children follow is not just a positive impact, but also a lasting impact as well.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key <unk> The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are starting some starting points for anyone willing to provide an education in body self-esteem that works.
An education is <unk> but to deal with this problem requires each of us to take care of each of us that take progress on the issue, and let's be a better model for women and girls in our own lives.
And challenging the current status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell the contribution of our politicians to <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start to judge people by what they are, not as you see.
All of us can start by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can make people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, when's the last time you <unk> a <unk>
In short, we need to work together as communities, as governments and as business and businesses, to truly change our culture, so that our children will grow to grow up to their children to grow up with the whole person, to be valuing the <unk> diversity, <unk>
We need to put people out to actually make the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them be them out on the big screen because we just make a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that they are never going to be aware of being the ones who are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think of what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who are in your mind?
A <unk>
A <unk>
A <unk>
Her <unk> A <unk>
It could simply be the woman who is at two seats. What would it mean for her if he was liberated from that <unk> voice inside his interior, that he would love him for not having a long legs -- I would get more skinny, and I was a <unk> <unk> feet.
What would it mean for her if we were taking care of this, and it takes its potential for that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are <unk> us.
But let's go back to our children the truth.
<unk> that the way you see is just one part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and for how they make us feel.
They would encourage self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compare to other people.
And we work together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of age today, will become safe change agents in themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
On top of November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and he killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
They initially was saying it innocent. but being prisoner for other <unk> in the company of others, they started planning in attacks at about 12 of the 12 icons of New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the U.N.
Fortunately, those plans to be transferred by an informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb of 1993 in the World Trade Center, couldn't escape it.
And later <unk> would be convicted of their involvement in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, as he was he was a <unk> engineer with a loving American <unk> teacher in elementary school, the two of them made everything possible for giving me a happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, including most Muslims come to meet.
For experience, I saw that when people take time to <unk> it doesn't really require a lot to look at the same things in life.
However, in all religion in all human group, there is always a tiny fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that they think that they have to use all of the possible media so that everyone lived as well.
A few months before arrest he sat with me and explained to me that in the last weekends he and a few friends, they had been going to training them at Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go to the next day.
We got to <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, I was <unk> by the FBI.
When I had my father <unk> I helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to point to about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that shot him gave the little light light on the goal and, for sure, of all, especially me, the goal broke on fire.
My uncle went back to the other and Arabic, said <unk> <unk>
From such a father, a son.
All of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter. But just a few years later, I understood what they were going to do so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be convicted of putting on putting on one van loaded with 700 pounds of explosives in the northern rainforest of the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and <unk> to other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times. That instability during my childhood was not allowed to make a lot of friendships.
Every time I was starting to feel comfortable close to someone that was now <unk> and going to another city.
As I was always myself the new face of the class that was often the victim of <unk>
<unk> secret -- my identity to avoid being the white thing, but being the new of the class silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I would spend it at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't develop social skills, to say <unk> <unk> <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I became opera to judge people, based on indicators <unk> like race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put to test my way to think, was during the presidential presidential elections.
In a <unk> program I participated in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group got to become the subject of juvenile violence -- as I had been victim of <unk> almost my whole life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids with whom we had done friendship, was Jewish people.
I took several days to come out to light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
Never before I had had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud of being able to beat the barrier that my whole life had made me believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came back when I got a summer work in Bush <unk> an amusement park.
I met people from all sorts of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
And all of the life had taught me that <unk> was a sin -- and by extension, all gay men were bad <unk>
By the chance, I had a chance to work with gay actors there, in an show, and I could see that several of them were the most glorious and less critics who had seen in life.
Having been <unk> I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat <unk> exactly the way I wish to be treated.
And so I could contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is to be homosexual but I do know what is to be asked by something beyond my control.
Then he came up with the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me be <unk> honest with my <unk> and she was helping me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, has nothing to do with character.
In a lot of ways he became my own figure, in a moment that I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my own life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mom about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something to keep in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of someone who had had enough <unk> <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much negative energy is needed to keep all that hate in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I decided to go out and put me on a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, one day, who is trying to take the violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, than even though I gave myself to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, and the loss that terrorism has been produced in their lives.
By the victims of terrorism to speak against those acts of terrorism talking, as rejection of my father.
With this simplicity I put myself in here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Right now there is a film that was projected in your minds.
It's an incredible movie <unk>
It's in 3D and has the sound of what you hear and you see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has visible, taste and texture.
<unk> your body, your hunger your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and anger and happiness.
It has memories, like your childhood moments that you project in front of your eyes.
And there's constantly a voice superimposed on your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the mind of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths about the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film, you, you, and you.
There's nothing to make it more directly.
At least, I know that I have an <unk>
I have no certainty that you are aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't aware of it, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we need to do to produce results without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
Science by nature, it is objective to it.
<unk> by nature, it's subjective it.
So there's never a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, I would get that vision.
psychology was studying behavior -- <unk> behavior, studying the brain -- but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there was very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for the science to <unk> the <unk>
And since then, there was a real blowout, a blooming of the scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. I was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of consciousness in consciousness was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this kind of great work that I presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand much better, for example, brain areas that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of <unk>
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of mental experience, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain that by saying that this kind of work of neuroscience does answer some questions that we want to explain consciousness. What do certain areas of the brain do and what it would look like?
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> <unk>
There's actually no easy problem with consciousness.
It doesn't address the real puzzle of this <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give the <unk>
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors -- how they operate <unk> how they work <unk> how they are <unk> and <unk> the living organisms, all of these are questions about how the target works.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we speak, how we speak, how we speak, how we speak, how we speak, how we talk, all these things about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about the behavior are between the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why it is that all behavior is accompanied by an <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't still have to say.
I'm a <unk> of the heart.
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works. For a long time, I would hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that it didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to tell us at this point.
We have a chain of wonderful explanations -- we got used to this, the physics explains chemistry, the chemistry explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to manipulate that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think consciousness, right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate our worldview, but we don't know yet how.
And with an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at principle <unk> crazy before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, which is here today, has one.
Its crazy idea is that there is no such difficult problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the actual subjective movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you have to do, is to explain the functions of the brain, the behaviors of the brain, and this is where everything needs explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a pure consciousness theory based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and many others, that vision is pretty close to simply denying that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I'm in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
<unk> are sometimes taking some aspects of the universe as bricks -- the space and the mass.
They make fundamental laws that are <unk> as the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties are not explain in any more basic terms.
Rather, they think about the contrary, and that's where the world is constructed.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental thing is <unk>
In the 19th century, Hitler, discovered that you can't tell the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts <unk> space, time, mass, the basic laws of the <unk> and <unk> the electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those laws are <unk>
I think that's the situation we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- <unk> space, time, mass mass, then load, for logic -- there is to be <unk>
The most natural thing would be <unk> the same as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens the path to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- the space, the time, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass, the
The physicists sometimes say we want to do fundamental fundamental laws that we can put them into a <unk>
The focus of consciousness is like this.
We want to find very fundamental laws as simple that we can put them into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision sometimes is called <unk> <unk> all of us, <unk> in mind, every system is conscious, not only the humans, the dogs, the mice, the flies, the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It is not that a <unk> can be filled with distress when you think of "Oh, I always read the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that maybe photons can have any element of raw feeling -- subjective feeling -- a <unk> precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would anybody think about something so <unk>
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's <unk> like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that <unk> thinking with the physical process, is <unk> the consciousness with information.
Whenever there is information processing, you have consciousness.
<unk> of <unk> complex as in a human being, and of complex <unk>
<unk> of simple information, simple awareness.
Something very exciting is that in recent years, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed it <unk> with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration, which is <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And it's supposed to be able to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there's a level of information integration of information, as significant as consciousness -- rather important.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, the particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of consciousness from zero.
It actually raises a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers have often observed that physics is <unk>
We set out the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality underlying the underlying reality.
As Stephen Hawking's explains Stephen Hawking, where does fire <unk>
From <unk> vision the equations of physics can be left as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not outside of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's there in the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to address our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that had consciousness, then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hungry.
I think we think about this, this tends to transform your visions, while what matters in ethical terms and <unk> is not both the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask awareness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has a complicated information processing, so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they are very serious ethical problems about the ethics of smart computers and the ethical <unk>
Finally, you can ask for consciousness <unk> the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group like the audience at a TED Talk, we have a TED collective consciousness, an internal film for this whole whole bunch of TED movies from every single <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think that at least it's a question you must take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually more sure to the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is a universal thing to be universal.
Vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go on the right path to a serious awareness.
If not, well, this is probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve at night in the morning.
But I think we finally will be going to happen.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small village in all Victoria.
He had a very normal, low profile of education.
I went to school, I met with my friends, and I was excited about my sisters.
Everything was normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to give them a prize for the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice but there is a problem.
She's actually not accomplished anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low underside in my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing to be extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as an achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
years later, I was in the second part of teaching in the second part of teaching in a high school in <unk> just after about 20 minutes in the previous class, a boy raised her hand and said, "Hey, when to give your <unk>
And I said, "What <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law law for about the good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your speech <unk>
When people in the wheelchair, they talk about <unk> things in the school?"
"Why?" in the classroom.
And it was then when I realized, this child had experiences with disability and disability objects.
And we don't are. And it's not about the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We're there to inspire.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you. Right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we are lying in relation to disability.
Yes, they have been sold by the lie that disability is something <unk> A billion of the capital lines.
It's something bad and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not something bad and it doesn't make you remarkable.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You might have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad deal.
Or this <unk> "Your <unk> is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before it <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a lot of them.
You may have seen one of the girl with no hands by drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with carbon fiber <unk>
And there are a lot of these images, which are what we call <unk> inspiration.
And I use the porn porn term -- because we would take a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we will bring the disability to the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, for too bad that it is my life, it could be worse.
I could be that people."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the number of times that I've been fascinated by weird <unk> to express that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was going to happen before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I was getting up in the morning and remembering my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images, those images are attached to people with disability to benefit people without disability.
They're there so you can see them and think that things aren't so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a tough thing.
There are some things.
But the things that we currently are not the things that you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately <unk> because I was called the so-called social model of <unk> which tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very pleased with him.
So the things I need to do, and I've learned to take the best of their ability as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They're simply using their bodies taking the best of their ability.
So it's really just just a <unk> in the way we do it, when we share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why that happens.
It's because of the lying, because they have been sold in this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "Why are you not going to be inspired by <unk>
And I actually know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability all over time.
However, I don't realize that I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> which is a great idea to use a little bit of <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that you fall over.  <unk> the ingenious trick of how to get a mobile phone battery into the car battery.
Great.
We learn about the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our repetition -- but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really think that that lie that you have been sold about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us a hard life.
And that quote: <unk> in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles to a stretch of stairs has never made it become a <unk>
Never.   So let's go on to a television screen, I won't make the subtitles for people who are <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to actually live in a world where disability is not exception, but norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> don't be considered <unk> nothing for being in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people with disability that we are <unk> by getting out of bed and remembering our names at the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the real achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child at 11 grade in a high school in Melbourne is not a little bit surprised that his new teacher is a wheelchair <unk>
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think you're going to know about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to see <unk> reality and professional soccer with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today I'm just going to answer one of those questions, so please do not get <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but <unk> reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and will happen because we have the tools to do it, and people need to learn, because <unk> reality will change our lives both like the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to <unk>
The first step, is what I'm wearing <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows you to see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is to be a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you will run with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what is running through the game of the game of 160 percent of the <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 pounds <unk> us trying to <unk> them with everything else.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
So let's take some videos to show you what the Google would use under the helmet, give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of <unk> practices because the idea of the emerging technology is an underwater going up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
So a moment. I had a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is to be <unk> in the football field from the perspective of the <unk> perspective.
You may have realized that we lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> of <unk> mice.
eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more about the feeling being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, be their favorite players -- and you have asked me on YouTube and in <unk> "We can see from the angle of a field <unk>
It's a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get out of <unk> how do we take it to the next <unk>
We took it at that level using something called <unk> <unk> that surely many of you know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality device ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, by this video.
Man: Oh, no.
No, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That is the experience of a man in a Russian roller coaster for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you put a video of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with your arm before they run and do a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of Adrian <unk>
When I could be <unk> running by the <unk> throwing the ball back into the bottom of the network? I would be <unk> by making a <unk> on <unk>
What will be your experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 <unk> like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the sales of diapers for adults.
But this is not still <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk> reality.
How can we achieve the reality of <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality <unk> when <unk> <unk> and owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So, here's a quick review of technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore had a <unk> to her <unk> <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to be <unk>
More people saw the game because it was more exciting, more fast.
In 1994, the <unk> he put radii in the <unk> of <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, most entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that they're a player coming back to your group, and you see their next move shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you carry on. You don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
Or to memorize the strategy.
They just come out to the field and they react.
And the coaches want it, because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose games, and they hate to lose games.
If you lose parties like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But <unk> reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your game.
How do you do that?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every single corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people on the bottom.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information is send to your players.
The good teams will know about it.
The bad will have the information <unk>
This is going to take good teams of bad guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis will stop being pledged alone.
Who would also be for <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that they are the <unk>
You would get the ball and <unk>
<unk> an open receiver -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight -- you would tell you that a defense behind you are going to kill you, they don't know it, but the system of <unk> will be <unk>
It impacts the area of protection.
Another <unk> you tell you that there's an open receptor.
You would get the <unk> but you <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land, but the receptor sees in its bombsight an area of grass that lights up and can modify the race.
He <unk> <unk> <unk> running and <unk>
The public <unk> and the fans have followed the move from every angle.
This is something that will create a massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to do lots of people -- I see it because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
Do you want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use just like bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, being somewhere else.
We know what this technology is worth like, <unk>
It generates billions of dollars a year.
But how much does this technology work for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad is their actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much does this technology do for a gay Uganda in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how they live <unk>
How much is it worth of a <unk> or a Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science rather than sticky notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the <unk> reality gets close.
The questions we make, the decisions we take and the challenges we face, <unk> as usual of us.
Thank you.
I was fascinated by 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years ago, the southern tip of the County <unk> which includes the <unk> <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known for its beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its inspirational architectural lifestyle.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The <unk> Bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer the bridge to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is essentially testing <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to his death from that bridge.
Some people believe that travel between the two towers will bring them to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as a bit of it, so that every one of them is affected by all of your concerns and pain, and the waters that go underneath your soul.
But let me tell you that it happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one drop of four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The <unk> the <unk> some of which we make vital organs.
Most of them die in impact.
The ones that no, normally <unk> in the water <unk> and then <unk>
I don't think that those who are going to make this method of suicide will notice the death of the death of the death that they <unk>
This is the wire.
Except around the two towers, there are 32 inches of steel on the bridge.
This is where most people are going to get before they had to take their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and in its darkest time, it's very difficult to bring it back.
I took this photo last year while this young man was talking to an officer looking at her life.
I want to tell you with joy that we got successful that day to bring it back over the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> suicide, but to the officers too.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, medical officers and psychologists train the new official the U.S.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him at the age 22 of the past year by getting a call from a possible target subject sitting in the cord near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I watched Jason <unk> talking to a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Jason was just 32 years old, and I had flown up to here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up until here two times before New Jersey to try to kill suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> I asked if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology of <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out of <unk> <unk> and all sorts of <unk> against man.
The only thing in the box was hope.
Then Jason said, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped <unk> leaned on the right, and it was.
This kind of kind and intelligent guys in New Jersey had just taken away from life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi rabbi called me to see how he was.
The parents of Jason had been order.
<unk> damage from suicide affects a lot of people.
Let me ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved out out suicide <unk>
What would you do?
<unk> what does it say?
In my experience, you don't just have to talk about, but you have to listen.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels because you probably don't know.
It's just there, you can be the inflection point they need.
If you think somebody's <unk> you don't have a fear of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is, <unk> in the similar circumstances you've thought to end his life, you've had these <unk>
Tell the person in front of you can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and they're never going to be <unk> to believe that there is nothing that you can do with <unk> social isolation and a losing interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you his letter.
She lost his son on the 19th of January this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and it's with his permission and blessing he read it.
"Hi, I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home to talk about their friends talking to their friends, and so on.
I'm still fairly <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike will really come home.
Mike was driving up to San Francisco to see the game of the 49 with his father the 19 from January.
He never got there.
I called the police of <unk> and we would call it as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and reported to me that the Mike car was down on the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been before without having a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end up with it.
My prayers are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the <unk> Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not one cemetery.
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man who I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I wrote a radio call by a possible guy in the sidewalk sidewalk near the north.
I got my motorcycle on the sidewalk and watched this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When I saw me, cross immediately the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the time and the next time, I heard like Kevin talked about her depression and despair.
Kevin decided to come back to that lane go back on that lane and give it another opportunity.
When Kevin <unk> I <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that he made it to <unk> and <unk> and life is another <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I <unk>
He stopped me talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I'd like to give you a <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the <unk> events and you're one of the reasons that Kevin keeps with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it's been properly <unk>
It would take Kevin when I was only six months, completely unconscious traits of all those traits <unk> but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, as the said.
We thank God for you.
Actually in debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end she writes -- <unk> <unk> When I visited the General San Francisco at night, that night, you were <unk> like the patient.
I know I know I had to do it.
Now Kevin is an <unk> father and member of the society.
Talk openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story inspire others.
<unk> is not just something I have found in the work.
It's personal.
My grandfather had a poison.
That act, even though he finished their own pain, I had a chance to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people -- or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think of hurt another person.
They just want their own pain <unk>
Usually this is achieved only three things: you will sleep or alcohol or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved in -- I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
During that time, I would get my hand in three times.
On the end, he looked at me, and he said, "I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those ones that have jumped from the bridge and lived in and that you can talk about it, that one percent or <unk> most of those people have said that the next one that they end up from side the railing had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I say to people, the bridge is not only connected to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or a bridge that we do is something that everyone and each of us should work to be able to do.
<unk> can prevent.
There's hope. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you're not here, but in your inner mind, you know what you are, and a question you ask you, "How do you tell you that?
I must be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I am alone.
When I became a model I felt that I had finally had the dream that I had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth, with my inner self.
For complicated reasons, I'm going to go later on, when I look at this picture, I think, <unk> <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that I'm getting started.
We all love our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value value to get rid of the limitations of the skin by the color of the skin or the beliefs of those around us.
They're people who always challenge the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years -- many of my neighbors -- a lot of my friends, my agent would even ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called revelation.
This is mine.
I was recorded as <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, and I always carried this shirt in my head.
And my mom wondered, "Why do you always have that t-shirt in <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender has always considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, is something more complex and <unk>
Because of my success, I never told myself to share my story, not because it thought to be what I'm bad for, but why the world deals with those of us who want to be <unk>
Every day I thank you to be a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who embrace me as I am.
Many aren't so lucky.
There's a long tradition in <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a Hindu goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman came in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me, this is the kind of woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when she was still a man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the head of a contest of beauty <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> <unk>
He told me that if she was <unk> from the overhead <unk> and the wardrobe -- and that night, I won in <unk> I won by <unk> and he was a third <unk> between 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of <unk> of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was the beauty of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I went to remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom. I had moved to San Francisco, and he called me and told me that he passed my green card application that I could go live to the U.S.
I was shocked.
I told my mother, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know that if you ask the United States, you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested that I gave him two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was <unk> in Thailand at 19 years.
It's funny that in some of the most rural cities from Thailand to perform the most <unk> sophisticated surgeries and secure.
At that time in the U.S., it was necessary to have surgery before they changed the name and the gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name <unk> and the female <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their document of identity means being able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears saw <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be a model.
Many aren't so lucky.
I think of this woman, <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who <unk> was living his truth, but he said, <unk> put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
Every third of November we make a global vigil by <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage because of a long history of people who are <unk> and he stood up to injustice.
These are <unk> P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't follow my truth alone and just me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, and fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that one day no longer has no more 20 percent <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Would you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Right. <unk> -- first, thank you with all my <unk>
My parents of support -- my parents in particular, to my family, which is really strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young women who have been <unk> and sometimes when they called me and they told me that their parents could not accept it, I would take the phone, he called my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked out. It's just identity identity -- it's just what is at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we were all assigned to a gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is to put on the table that sometimes that assignment, not block, and that there should be a space that allowed people to <unk> And this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice. Thank you.
In many <unk> and tribal societies, the parents are usually known for their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who have been met with her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending their rights in 2007. And when they moved their efforts in 2011, and the <unk> National Prize <unk> became very famous -- a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of mankind, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when at birth to a girl, his birth would not be <unk>
It's not welcoming for his father, nor for his mother.
The neighborhood comes next to the mother and no one message the father.
And a mother got a lot to have a little girl.
When she gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, gets sad.
When she gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, she feels guilty like a criminal.
Not just Mother <unk> but the daughter is just <unk> when it grows, it suffers from as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, you get home and the school would take up to their brothers.
At the age of 12 years, in a way, it has a good life.
Can you be <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when you go into adolescence, when it is 13 years old, you know that it comes out of your house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of your house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes called the honor of his father and his brothers and his family, and if I had the code of that assumption honor, you could even kill.
And it's interesting that this piece of honor, not only does it affect the life of a <unk> also affects the lives of male members of the family.
So this brother <unk> the joys of her life and the happiness of his sisters in the name of honor.
And there's a more standard of <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl should be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the <unk>
The model of a good girl should be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and embracing people's decisions and mother and people's decisions and the decisions of the elderly even if they don't will.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if you put it with an old man, it has to be <unk> because he doesn't want to be a <unk> <unk>
If the <unk> too young -- it has to take it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson to <unk> her daughter and the same lesson of honor his children.
And this vicious cycle goes on and continues.
And we got brothers and sisters, when I was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at her eyes, believe me, I was extremely <unk>
And a lot before I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> of <unk> and he called my daughter so for her.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I was <unk> a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she carried out when she was four and a half years and a half and a half years, I was <unk> in my school.
You might ask, why should I mention a little girl in a school?
Yes, I have <unk>
You can give it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in poor countries, in tribal societies, in tribal societies, it's a great event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and her name.
One key to school means that it's entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when they were <unk> the <unk> form and was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I was never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason why I value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, thought it had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
<unk> to sit with me when my friends came to see me.
I got her to go with me at different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this was not just for her, just to <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and boys alike.
I used education for <unk>
My daughters, I taught the students, forget the lesson of the <unk>
I taught the students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
They were <unk> and sisters, getting more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights and, in particular, for women's rights.
His name was <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's involvement in all political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
So girls are banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers that were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have those people who kill and <unk> when you're talking about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10 years, he got up and raised in the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the blog on the BBC, he offered herself for the New York Times documentaries and he talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
They were <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and October 9 o'clock in October 2012, was shot at his head.
It was one day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
While my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I told my wife <unk> <unk> <unk> by what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And he said, <unk> she said, "Please don't give you <unk>
<unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play because of the cause of peace, because of the cause of peace, and for the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and you get sick.
Both were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words were a lot to me, and I don't have to ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital, and I had severe headaches and some strong headaches because their facial nerve was cut down, and I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to <unk> "I'm okay with my smile <unk> and with the <unk> in my face.
I'm going to put it right. Please get it right.
It was a comfort for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> and sisters, we've learned from her to resist the hardest moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women, it's like any 16-year-old girl.
<unk> when it's not just their task.
They fight her brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is there special in my mentoring that has made so bold to <unk> so bold and expressive and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't.
He didn't cut his wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined by the Google group, where I have had a <unk> to my <unk> the Google Google visualization -- but all the work that I'm talking about today about the brain science here -- I did before I join Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there's a stigma when you get to a brain surgery.
You're still just as smart or not?
If you wouldn't be <unk> you'll be <unk>
After <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray, but it was the dead sticky part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide what amount to take, from over a dozen chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations and mix of chemicals, and try to <unk> to follow alive.
More than I've been saved by little.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I will be able to get the dose of <unk> because there really doesn't have a clear map that says it in <unk>
I started trying to mix with different <unk> and I was shocked by looking at how little changes in the doses were dramatically my <unk> my sense of who I was, my way of thinking, my behavior with others.
One particularly <unk> case for a few months, I made a dose and chemical chemicals for a 16th man, and I was amazed at how my thoughts changed my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, a lot of times in the past have met several kinds of guys like this, or maybe some <unk> versions of it.
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was getting a lot of <unk> to fix a problem that I had in front of it, and just didn't happen to it.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of men and what they have to do -- since then I've been better at men.
And what I was trying to do to do is to be able to adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, was to regain my intelligence after the disease and <unk> my creative thought, my flow of ideas.
<unk> to think almost always in imagery, and that became my key point of reference to how I can get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if they were <unk> <unk> new ideas and recreating situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> see things in the same way.
They thought the images and mental ideas were the same thing.
There are those who <unk> this idea, and there are a lot of arguments about how the mind works, for me is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to the thinking and <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have lots of great mental <unk> really, very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take this mental images of my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director was able to use its imagination only to lead to the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way that creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to achieve this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments that were done by two of the leading groups in neuroscience.
Both of them used MRI technology, image functional MRI to represent the brain here, you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his Harvard colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of the brain of a person who looks at an image.
The middle of the middle shows the scan of the brain of the same individual as you get to see that same image.
The column on the right was created by the contents of the central column on the left, and you see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is repeated in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagining that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the lab at Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn brain waves into visual magnetic fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were moving their brains to create a great <unk> of the brain in the video sequences.
And then, I showed you a film with new, new people, new animals, and as well as they become a new <unk>
The computer using only brain brain information to show you what it looks like the person was seeing.
And on the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This blew us out.
We're pretty close to getting there.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image and when you can imagine that same image, you think of the brain the same <unk>
This has been done with the brain scanning brain scanning systems today, and its resolution increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How did we achieve that?
There's a lot of techniques to do that.
One is opening up the skull and to introduce electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
Many of them are proposing new techniques of projection by images, even -- <unk> with the recent outcome of MRI -- first we need to ask -- this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get bigger resolution is with bigger magnets -- but to this point, most <unk> magnets only offered small improvements in the resolution, not increases for thousands of us as we need to.
I propose this idea: instead of larger, we make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements and make a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort on MRI was to make really big, right?
And yet, most recent advances in <unk> of clever and bright solutions <unk> and <unk> in <unk> and <unk> radio <unk> into MRI systems.
At your time, instead of a magnetic field they would weigh flat magnetic patterns -- structured magnetic patterns <unk> at the radio <unk>
So when we combine magnetic patterns with the patterns of <unk> radio processing patterns, we can actually increase the information that you can get in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then divide our growing knowledge into the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands of us need.
By using the <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood of blood <unk> but the hormones and <unk> that I mentioned and perhaps even the moral activity of direct neural activity.
Will we be able to put our ideas into direct shape to the digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be <unk> to use it as a tool to amplify them, our skills of thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
We have a few more choices to open up this door.
Anyway, please pick a year, it will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take much more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'll talk to you tonight about getting out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet.
I think we all have <unk>
His self is probably telling someone for the first time that the loves or telling someone who's pregnant, or telling someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have done through life.
Everything is a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and getting out of that closet is universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
Many years ago, I worked in the South Side <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I was there, I had to go through various stages of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> <unk> I didn't have my armpits, to quote the letters of <unk> I gave <unk> as a <unk>
And it will be <unk> that by the <unk> of my short pants and I would tell you my head -- I was just telling you a little boy -- "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And there would be uncomfortable at the table.
I had my jaw a little more, I would take my jaw a little more, I would take my <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother <unk> a cold look at his son.
But I would not say anything, and <unk> on the inside.
And I got to the point that every time I was going to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that the next time I would say something.
It would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was prepared to get in full of the female issues at the table   I had Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues" I <unk>
And then I took it down and I went down and down and my backs got a four year-old girl with a pink dress -- looking at what it's not a challenge for an <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "Are you guys or <unk>
And so I took it back into the back of it, and I got out of <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is <unk>
I have the short hair like the one of a kid, and I saw a little girl, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress -- and sometimes you like to use a comfortable <unk>
OK, I am more of the girl in a ninja pajamas.
And that girl looked at me <unk> and he said, "My favorite leg is <unk> and she has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all like, "Oh, it's a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the easiest conversation than ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both of us were setting up one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and I know, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But in the dark, you can't know what color the walls.
You just know how it feels like a closet.
That's how my self is not different from yours or yours or yours.
I'm going to give you 100 reasons for why I get out of my self was harder to come out of their head, but this is the <unk> The hard thing is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who has declared <unk> is harder than saying it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is harder than to say to your five-year-old <unk>
There's no more difficult, there's just the hard thing.
We should stop to classify what it's hard to do for another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we need to just feel empathy because we all live a hard thing.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least safer than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls made out of the walls is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine about 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse, a horse, a dress and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't the lesbian who was prepared to fight every child in four years who would go to the coffee.
I was frozen because of fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my gay grenade and moving just a muscle is the scariest thing I've ever done.
My family, my whole friends that I've spent my entire life trying to not get to <unk> and now the world was turned around purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> they will kill you.
One of my most memorable grenade was in my sister.
It was the first time that many guests were invited to know that I was gay, and when I do my Lady of honor, in my black dress and <unk> I walked around the tables and finally came to one where my parents were my parents' friends, people who knew me for years.
And after talking a moment, one of the women <unk> <unk> Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yes, the truth is, we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about <unk>
So what is your TV TV show.
Our <unk> <unk> <unk>
And you know who we were passionate about, <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in waiting to show desperately his support, to get me to know that he was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses a <unk> shirt <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that time, as you have all the Scud <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing to <unk>
It's like that the difficult conversations continue to be my strong point.
Ask for anyone that I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of the Girl House.
Now, please see this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it means to go out of any self is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> the <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee didn't have <unk> but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others must know we also suffer.
Number two: Sean <unk> simply <unk> <unk>
If you know that they're gay, <unk>
If they say to their parents that maybe they could be gay, they will maintain the hope that it could change.
Don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate its truth.
They would never be influenced by that.
And some of you can be injured -- they will be injured by what they've done, but I'm never sorry about what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that's not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find yourself in a dark side? <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel pretty much themselves, but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
I mean, what is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence has seen -- a productive example has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> which "The question of whether a machine may think is so interesting as the question of if an underwater can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a <unk> of computer pioneers like Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, <unk> a program to try to understand the fundamental fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let me a step.
Let's start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you're from a <unk> race that you don't know about the biology of Earth or from the Earth of the Earth or the intelligence of the Earth or you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from an alien race that doesn't have any concept about the intelligence of the Earth, it would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, at a certain point in time, the asteroids that we <unk> the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And that's why I claim this is the same question to understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led several years ago, I looked at a variety of themes through science, through various disciplines, that <unk> I think, towards a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there's been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be <unk> fixed to the development of intelligence, and, in particular, for the development of human states that <unk> the diversity of potential future.
Finally, on robotic movement planning have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action to maximize complex tasks.
And so taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I said, from a number of years ago, there is a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I saw.
So what you're looking at here is a claim that intelligence is an effective force, which acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keep the open options, with a <unk> force with the diversity of possible future accessible, Yes, to an imminent time <unk>
In a nutshell, the intelligence doesn't like to stay <unk>
intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep the open-ended choices.
And so, having to realize this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human intelligence.
<unk> <unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you a video that I think, I'm going to show you some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more <unk> or <unk> during their life should have tendency to conditions more favorable to the existence of smart beings like us.
But what if that connection is <unk> <unk> between entropy and intelligence and <unk> <unk>
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but it actually arises from her?
To find out, we have developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system that you find in it.
<unk> <unk> was able to pass multiple animal tests of animal intelligence, play games, and even make money <unk> actions, all that without being clear to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a foot of foot without <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave them a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance will have applications for humanoid robotics and human care.
This tools will have applications in smart manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate pulling off opposite extremes of a rope at the same time to liberate the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the task model.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see it successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
So here we see <unk> digging new connections into a social network where the friends are constantly <unk> and keep successful the network well.
This same network <unk> also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, discovering with success and using the Panama Canal to expand the global level to the world from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously to discover and run a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated series of <unk> and successfully increase assets under their exponentially.
This ability for risk management will have huge applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of <unk> behaviors such as the use of tools, smart cognitive <unk> and the social cooperation -- all flow of one equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
Let's go back to the beginning of the use of the term of the term -- the work -- there was always the concept that if you were <unk> smart machines, there would be an unexpected rebellion, in it.
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of rebellion that we lay in reverse.
It's not that the machines are getting smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the impulse to take the control of all the future is a more fundamental principle than intelligence, than general intelligence can actually emerge directly from control, rather than being backwards.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
They often ask me, how do you look for goals about this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to pass the descendants to help them build artificial <unk> or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Even in the last few years, we've expanded a lot of our knowledge to how it fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission for NASA has discovered thousands of potential planets orbiting other stars, which points to the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the intensity of <unk> <unk> from stars when planets go ahead of them, and blocking a little bit of that light that we get in.
The data gathered by Kepler is showing the sizes of planets besides the distance that there are between them and their star star.
So together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the land of our solar system, and also the amount of light they receive from their <unk>
Instead, this gives clues about whether these planets that we find are <unk> or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this treasure of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
<unk> was the hottest recorded.
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us for millennia, now are now dying in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale are rapidly <unk> our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a scientist in the weather, or not <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet being influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in finding life in the universe I can tell you that the more look for planets like the Earth, more like our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the <unk> planet and the planets that we know better."
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially habitable world that shows this for a mission like <unk>
In fact, it is possible that Mars has been <unk> in the past, and partly because we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> track its surface in search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission are taking samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Women are now offered not just short space flights but also the ability to live on Mars.
But even though all of these <unk> images are remind the deserts, of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with <unk> ideas and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the areas of our planet that are still left by <unk> places that are actually compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry and <unk> places, the air is fresh and full of oxygen <unk> by our forests to thousands of miles away.
I'm worried that this kind of excitement for the colonization of Mars and other planets will get a big and sad planets and the belief that Mars is going to wait for us to save us from this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly <unk> Earth.
And so I would like the exploration of <unk> I'm deep to disagree with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to safeguard humanity is like figuring out that the captain of Titanic will tell us that the <unk> really will have place later on the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for existing exploration, and preservation of Earth will be <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of trying to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments here in our world look like <unk> aliens.
It's just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain spaces in the hostile and <unk> areas of the ground, we may be able to meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an experiment -- the paradox of <unk>
Many years ago, the physicist, Enrico Enrico Fermi said to realize that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of life of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to be able to consider living between the stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of planets that are going to build this development.
It's arrogant to think that just the colonization <unk> will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and exploration, <unk> can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to express the hostile environments on Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
And a few years ago, I was holding my own home.
And as I was on the front porch looking in my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window out of the window that were at the dining table of the dining table where there was <unk>
And so fast I tried to open all the other doors and windows and all were all right.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get it, and it was cold.
I could not go home from my friend from Jeff <unk> to spend night, because he had an early flight to Europe the next morning, and I was holding my passport and my suitcase.
<unk> expensive, but I'm sure not more expensive than a half at the middle of the night, so I thought that in spite of the circumstances, I was very stuck.
I'm a couple, and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that your heart rate increases, <unk> levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thinking.
And when I arrived at <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I began to ask myself, if there was something I could do, systems that could put in your place, which would be bad things to happen.
Or at least, if bad things happen, which will make the probability of a total <unk>
So I got to think about that, but until a month later, my thoughts <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> who was the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed he told him to broke the window, and that I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that I had been practicing something called <unk> retrospective
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what's the <unk>
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and tries to figure out what came out wrong, right?
In <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that could come out wrong, then try to figure out what can do to prevent things or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so <unk>
I'm going to start with the obvious thing.
In the house, it <unk> a place for things that are actually lost easily.
This sounds of common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of the important things, where the fish are right, where the fish are where the fish are in which places are <unk> where the tribes are friends and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that was <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows them to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, cut the sense of <unk> and they could still find his nuts.
They weren't using the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move very much.
This is the reason for losing keys on your car, <unk>
So at home <unk> a place for keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport, a particular drawer for your passport,
For your reading goggles.
If you go to a place and you're <unk> with it your stuff will always be there when you get them.
What about <unk>
Take on your cell phone, a picture of your credit cards to drive, passport, <unk> by mail to yourself to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can be facilitate <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases cortisol.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress will not be at the best moment, and you have to put the systems on its site.
And there are perhaps no more stressful situation than when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, of having to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a dear party to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And to talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of medical decisions, and in fact for decision-making financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that you need to take out of a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, heart attack, <unk>
So you're thinking that you have high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard of the <unk> and you know it's one of the most important drugs in the world today -- even more likely you know the people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you should do then, a statistic that you have to ask for the most doctors don't want to talk, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number we need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to have surgery in any medical procedure before they help a person.
And you must think of what kind of <unk> statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not a doctor, and if it's somebody else's fault as I am.
We haven't understood very well <unk> mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs work only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number you need to treat the most widely <unk>
How many people have to take it before they can help a person?
300.
This is according to the research research research <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently by <unk>
I see the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before we avoid a single heart attack, stroke brain or another <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one chance for 300 to lower my <unk>
Why not it -- <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you should ask for a more statistic and it is, <unk> of the <unk> effects. Right?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of the patients.
And those include things that include <unk> and muscle pain and <unk> pain, but now they think, "The five percent is not very likely to go to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
remember that under stress doesn't think clearly.
So think about how to do this with time, so you don't have to make the credit chain on the act.
300 people are taking the drug, right? A person has prescribed five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get <unk> by the drug that will help you help the drug.
I don't say they should or not take the <unk>
I just say you must have this conversation with your medical doctor.
The medical ethics requires, is part of the beginning of informed consent principle.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number you need to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that most is done in the top men in the top of the prostate cancer, the number you need to treat is <unk>
So it is, 49 surgeries for a person who has helped it.
And the side effects in that case, are produced in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include <unk> or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if it's lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects we would just spend a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can make to make the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, you want a shorter life out of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things that they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change from the heat of the moment, but at least you are trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face with a <unk> you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending the metabolism on those things, it doesn't react very rapidly. You could get the food lunch so that none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational thought, as Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to <unk> to think about the future of these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail in time.
The idea is to think about the future how those <unk> could be able to put systems in the place that will help to minimize the harm, or to stop the bad things in the first place.
I went to the snow night in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor set up a combination of combination next to the door, with a key to the entry door in the same way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have a lot of letters that I have no <unk> and lots of text messages that I didn't read.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization like a <unk> and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite musical symbol.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to touch more <unk>
Two <unk> even more smooth.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree there, and it looks like no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be never delivered to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I would like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came during the 1800s, and over the 1800s, and over time, they mixed with local signs, and it developed the language that we know as a <unk>
So, it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And they taught me to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize that it's not true for nothing.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, really, in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a physical world, it is like I lived in a foreign country, following wind, their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms, <unk>
So how do I understand the sound like?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
It <unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen the <unk>
So I've learned for example for example.
"I don't know <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of <unk> <unk>
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating, you make sure that <unk> in the <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the more sound label than the average person does it.
I'm a <unk> of sound.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is about coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk>
<unk> on the road.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that the <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines contain sounds through the <unk> subtle and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, for me, making it with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic residence there.
Before this time, I'd worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has come into my field of art.
I'm going to tell you about the art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that you don't only experience through the ears.
I can feel that <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything that had been taught me in the sound of sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new job of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was <unk> with the amount of support and attention that I had.
I realized sound is like money, power, <unk> social currency.
In my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was a little bit of a listener.
And the sound is so powerful that I could be able to get it to me and my artistic work, or I could tell you.
I chose to tell me.
There's a massive culture around speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like it didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as well as to become my voice.
So I'm able to be relevant in our society today.
So in school, in school, and the <unk> I work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, I will ask for <unk> your voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value something like taking a loan from a very high interest rate.
If we will not continue to continue this practice, I feel that I could be able to do it in the <unk> and not have any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium -- I think of in the world of music.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot capture and express fully on the paper.
And the same is true of a concept in <unk>
The two are highly <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all of the meaning as much of the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, to understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> <unk> in many different ways.
If you're mapping a different standard for each finger as you play the piano, like facial expression, the movement of the body, the speed, the shape of the hand and so as you touch the piano, English is a linear language, as if it gets off, just a button at a time.
However, <unk> is more like a chord -- you need the 10 fingers in order to express a very clear concept or an idea of <unk>
If just a button would change the chord -- create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens with the music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when we use these different parameters, you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> <unk>
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see <unk> through the <unk>
If I had to make a sign and take it over and again, it could come to be like a piece of visual music.
So for example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and actually wears it.
This is all <unk>
If you get it, and you shake the speed, the visually looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same can say that the same can say <unk>
Amazing.
This is all night in this drawing.
And this led me to think about about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk>  I <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how the time is expressed in <unk> and how distance the body can express the changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present is two hands, and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is to spend a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> and the last one that is my favorite, with a very romantic idea and dramatic a dramatic idea at the same time.
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rhythm of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk> same time."
Look at <unk> right hand.
We have <unk> through your head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a way of hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do this with me?
All of the hands in top.
Now we're going to do so much in your head like your chest, as well as <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, pretty good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language languages around the world.
The second thing I'd like to show you is this. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in <unk>
Now, the third. Please get it back again.
And over again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and the chest but they transmit very different.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and thriving as well as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> does not automatically have any social value.
We have to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> I don't have to hear to learn music.
<unk> is a rich treasure.
I'd like to invite you to open his ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, you can fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "Can you take all of all, but then you have to <unk>
<unk> involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all of these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a grant of innocence or a bubble of ignorance must say, because adults lied to protect us from the awful truth.
At getting older, I learned that the adults also <unk> and that they're not very good at clean to clean up the other.
The time country, now I'm adult and I teach citizens and invention in the front school of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk around the beach in the beach with lots of garbage <unk>
So as good citizens, we got the <unk> and not drinking alcohol, not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the ocean contain plastic.
It's kind of scary.
And in the last few decades, we've been going out with these big ships and networks, and then in the last few decades, these pieces of plastic to look at them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use these huge boats at all.
So with my students, with ages of six to 15 years, we dream about making a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
So we started building this <unk> labor <unk> so that young kids are also able to participate.
And I'll tell you, kids who manipulate electrical tools, feel cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
And we collect the plastic and we reduce it into the size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to push them into something that we hope it works.
We decided that instead of collecting chunks of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the kids get achieved with the robots.
And then we actually created what we call "a <unk>
We're so quick to prototype prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we transform light and chambers and web cameras, and they put it into a floating robot that will slowly move through the water and through the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see the bits of plastic floating up through the sensor while the computer on board as the computer on board process this image and measure the size of each particle, to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone will get it even more.
The great thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I can investigate my immune problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very <unk>
You see the news, you see the Internet, the Internet, and you get through this image.
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning up an oil spill, just using the hands of the world in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that you drink a drink is the water where the water is produced, where the water is where the water where they live.
You can also see that the water is brown, the mud and the oil is also a brown color and when all of it happens, it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> that can spread through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help identify what's in the water.
This prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to look at a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help in a remote form to other children.
I was forced to do a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further, maybe to address a harder problem, and more close to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half and perhaps remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it started several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroyed various cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant of Fukushima, a power center close to water.
And today, according to the reports of an average of 300 tons are still <unk> of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure <unk> radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the <unk> coast -- and the majority of the time, it has safe looks blue.
Well, it's a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the accident and done independently with other scientists, the land, the river, the river, and we wanted to take the children.
Of course, not the <unk> parents don't know it.
But every night we went to the center of <unk> here you see the use of different masks here.
It might seem that they didn't take the serious work, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all their life.
Along with them, we discussed the data <unk> that day and talk about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the plant of nuclear power.
We created the <unk> we introduced <unk> to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
We were able to notice that radioactive dust would be transferred from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on this we organized an civil expedition closest to date.
We get closer to 1.5 miles of nuclear, and with the fishermen from the <unk> we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a <unk> of sediment as we invent and built.
Here is a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem with a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales -- also with open-source technologies and very simple source.
But at the same time, it's been more and more frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even begun trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit so small so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and turned it into the largest space -- dedicated to social impact and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong -- and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal chemistry, a little bit of biology, and you can basically build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become true of adults, and where adults can be children again.
Students: <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked ourselves, things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
So for example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the advanced age transforming their <unk> <unk> into new self-driving cars.
The plastic, oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible ones, but the worst legacy that we can leave our children are the lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, ordinary citizens -- creators -- we have to prepare the next generation to worry about the environment and the people, and so that I can really do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two cultures of radically <unk> design.
One is made of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of a single thread of silk.
One of them is synthetic the other organic one.
One is born on the environment, the other one had thought about.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that will be free.
The <unk> was a single tool of Michelangelo.
But living creatures are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, we took all the information out of it for every cell to work and to make it happen.
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have <unk> a world made out of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects like <unk> of different functions.
But you don't find a little bit of material that is <unk> in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> pores there.
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
One is acting mainly like filter the other mostly as barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there is no <unk> no <unk>
It's a system that gradually shifts its functionality through the variation.
Here's a split screen that represents my view of the world -- the double personality of every designer and an architect to work in working between the <unk> and the gene between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the growth between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the law, analysis and synthesis, is shown at two screens after me.
My job in the simplest simple level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, moving from assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask yourself, why now?
Why was it possible about 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where they connect four disciplines that offer designers access to tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please meet the minds and my hands of my students.
We are designing objects, products, structures and tools and tools through the scale of 24 meters of scale, like this robotic arm with a grasp of 24 meters in the basis that some day not too far in print <unk> buildings, and graphics to the nanoscale made out of genetically <unk> the <unk> in the dark.
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where every aperture is <unk> to shape light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> and this was for a fashion fashion fashion fashion chip with <unk> they're <unk> It's like a second skin made out of one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Along with a 3D printing piece of 3D printing we printed this layer and 3D skirt with no seams between cells -- I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid and soft materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution.
That designers have access to this high resolution <unk> and the <unk> instruments allow design products that are <unk> not only the way our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair, a chair at the very comfortable structural structural and also it absorbs sound.
So Professor Carter -- my collaborator went back to nature to <unk> and by designing this pattern of <unk> it becomes <unk>
We put this surface of 44 different properties -- which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, they will break down the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, as in nature, varies its functionality not by adding other material or another <unk> but continuously <unk> and <unk> the material property.
But it's the <unk> nature.
There are no parts in nature?
I didn't grew up in a religious Jewish home but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them was stuck and really define what I care about.
Like she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> tree <unk>
For that first tree -- there would be no difference between trunk, twigs, sheets and <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land did grow trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The Earth created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would be the design if objects were just made of <unk>
Would you get a better state of the <unk>
So we were looking for the material that we would take the kind of material of the tree in the tree with fruit, and we found it.
The second <unk> <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons is produced by organisms like shrimp, crabs <unk> and <unk>
We thought if we could tune their properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal <unk>  <unk> a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures to scale, it was built up a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of material on the process and create these structures made of one single material -- me long, 100 percent recyclable <unk>
When the pieces are ready, you let it dry up to find a natural form in the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process used to contain <unk> <unk> which appeared for the first time on the planet for a billion years ago, like we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition with no problems of mesh <unk> and if it <unk> even more, windows.
A little <unk> <unk> tree.
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a <unk> structure of shrimp into an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best two: for objects that are designed for <unk> on the sea, <unk> life <unk> and put in the ground, will help grow a tree.
The fit for our next exploration of design using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we must master bacteria and control their flow.
So as the <unk> table, we made our own table of items, new forms of life created <unk> made from <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> <unk> new biological <unk> inside very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We set up our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> engineered crops.
In our first piece of clothing, it was <unk> two <unk>
The first one is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the freshwater <unk>
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that lives in the human intestine.
It turns the light into sugar, the other use sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two microorganisms doesn't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution for design.
To hold these relationships, we have created a single channel that resembles the tract <unk> that will help you flow through these bacteria and to make it a function of the way.
So we began to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material according to the <unk>
If we wanted more photosynthesis, they will increase more transparent.
This digestive system <unk> when it stretches from one end to another, it goes to 60 feet.
This is half the length of a soccer field and 10 times as much as our intestine thin.
And here it is, as <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels of brilliant <unk> channels in their clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are very early creatures, only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that will increase <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that we will build our skin, we will provide the aquatic tissue and make our <unk>
Think of this as a form of edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
To do that, you always have to go back to nature.
And so now, you know that a 3D printer is that a 3D printer <unk>
You also know that nature doesn't do that way.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture a home within which they were <unk>
The manufacturing is not <unk> it's about this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination of two materials, but from two proteins in different <unk>
One is acting as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, by linking those fibers to each other.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm is first turned into the environment, creates a bone structure, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process, we attach a tiny magnet to the head of a <unk> <unk> to the <unk>
We put it into a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of dots in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the silk worm.
However, when you put the silk worm on a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that we had a coin <unk> and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different <unk> different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape of the <unk> structure is transmitted directly by the environment.
Often the silk worms are often <unk> into the death of their <unk> their silk <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that we were designing these templates we can shape the <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot.
We knew that the silk worms are <unk> into the darkest and the darkest areas that we use a solar system to reveal the distribution of light and the heat in our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays from light and heat and smell the silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get <unk>
<unk> worms were <unk> silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to engage with us.
We put them carefully on the lower edge of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> they <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much shorter than us.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
At <unk> biological silk about silk <unk> <unk> you give all this pavilion out of our integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> this is the length of the silk <unk>
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
<unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other one full empty arm.
If the last frontier of design is to give the products of products and the buildings around us, to form a two materials, the designers must bring together these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, that brings us from a design inspired by nature that is inspired by us, for the first time that we make in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever asked them, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they asked them for the first time.
You can stick it with your fingers.
Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked English, the <unk> and the art and he took the websites and he took the guitar into a band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard of us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with time this sense of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to give it up.
But then I was struck by something else, which is totally different, and I would be embarrassed about it, and I'm going to let myself absorb and I feel <unk> I've found it <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it to you.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I would like to go into that.
This pattern made me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how it was going to convert this whole career.
I thought I was supposed to choose one thing, to deny all my own passions, and I would try to <unk>
Another reason why it gave me so much anxiety a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong about this, and something bad about me because of nothing.
I was worried to be afraid of commitment, or being dispersed, or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to ask me then.
And they will tell themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I will tell you where they did -- learned from culture.
What do you ask is, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is, nobody cares about what they were going to be.
It's considered a naive question to make nice answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or want to be <unk>
We had a <unk> suit.
So this question is done again and again as we grow different forms, <unk> <unk> to high school students have a question you're going to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise before what you take away the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspired by kids to dream with what might be, it's not inspired to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, it does exactly the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though they would be able to be <unk> maybe <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be a <unk> and <unk>
Do you have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's a <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> magazine turned into <unk> <unk> teacher and <unk>
But most of the kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they are going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or real <unk> the idea that every one of us has something to spend during your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is, and I spend your life to it.
But if you're someone who is not connected in this way?
What if there are many different issues that show their curiosity and lots of different things that you want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And you feel like there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You are a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with many interests and creative activities.
It's a breath for that to say.
It could help if you divide up in three parts: a potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that you can see the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of Renaissance, the ideal was who I was okay with in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
They take any term that you like or <unk> your own one.
It seems to me as a kind of adapting to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or woe you should win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here are three superpowers <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
That is, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the intersection.
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in cartography, visualizing data, travel, mathematics and design, when I was <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk> <unk>
And <unk> and Rachel came up with this idea of a unique idea by its <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation occurs at intersections.
Hence the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all of their background, can access a lot of these intersection.
The second superpower, <unk> is fast learning.
When we get older, we <unk> for something, we're going to do it.
We looked at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> for having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of testing new things and coming out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to every new area that we are <unk> so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a complete time <unk> and founded <unk>
As a professional child <unk> an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest known <unk>
Before becoming a writer, <unk> was financial <unk>
He had to learn the mechanics of sales as well when he was starting their skills, and this ability helps it to write for the editors wanted.
<unk> is a loss of time to go to what you would tell you, even if at the end of the end of the <unk>
Is it possible to apply that knowledge in a totally different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower, <unk> is adaptability. That is, the ability to transform into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, other pages of web pages, sometimes a consultant for Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and, sometimes, James <unk>
It's valuable because it makes a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take out of different roles depending on the needs of your clients.
<unk> Company defines adaptability as the most important skill for development, to flourish in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to meet the needs of the marketplace, which really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you might lose if they're <unk> to reduce their targets.
As a society, we have a great interest in foster people to be themselves.
We have complex problems, we have <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to do in front of them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, specialists.
It would get rid of the belly knowing because they wanted to be neurosurgeons <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams make up a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive into depth and put in ideas, and <unk> provides a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all be designing lives and careers that are affecting how we are connected.
And unfortunately, to the <unk> in a large part of them are told to simply be more like their <unk>
And once said that, if there is one thing you take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with internal <unk> whatever it is.
If you are a heart attack, then you go through all the media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who have just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with your very many passions.
Follow their curiosity by those <unk> of <unk>
<unk> intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring takes us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, the world will be <unk>
Thank you.
In the year <unk> a woman named <unk> they took her to a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember the most basic details of your life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her, until unfortunately passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found weird plates and <unk> in the brain of a guy who had never seen before.
But even more surprising.
If we had been alive today, we couldn't give her to her more help than he was born, gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect ourselves from infections, many treatments for cancer, <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it has been moved into Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million worldwide.
But by 2050, we will affect 150 million which, by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 years or more, the chance of Alzheimer's disease will be almost one in two.
In other words, there is the probability that you spend their years with Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or want to want Alzheimer's.
In the U.S., Alzheimer's disease costs 200,000 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical care spends in Alzheimer's disease.
So today is the most expensive disease and its costs -- a rise of five times in 2050, as we get the generation of <unk> boom.
You may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical challenges of our generation.
But it's done relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's disease is the only one that cannot be able to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's disease than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research in the research.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research that in Alzheimer's disease despite the fact that we have more Alzheimer's disease and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people knows, but everybody <unk> Alzheimer's disease is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, all of all, as scientists, Alzheimer's disease with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy brain compared to the disease of a Alzheimer's patient to see the actual physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to unleashed a severe memory of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's disease significantly life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates, and weird <unk> in the <unk> brain does a century.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know they're made of protein molecules today.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that it folds like origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds right, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> dots are left in the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates, and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are a lot of steps, and the identification of which I can block is complex, like defuse a bomb.
I had a wire could do nothing.
<unk> others can make the bomb explode.
You have to find the right step that we can do, and then create a drug that it does.
Until recently, most of the wires have been reduced and expected the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> and physical chemicals, engineers, engineers, engineers.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now it's testing a new kind of drugs that blocking specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our latest results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos from what happened when we tested these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move with normality.
These maggots, on the other hand, have protein molecules that are falling into each other within them, as in humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly <unk>
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that we have <unk> and they live a normal life.
This is just a positive outcome -- but research as this shows that Alzheimer's disease is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of <unk> there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But in order to grow that hope, to defeat Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to convince us that Alzheimer's disease is a disease and if we can fix it, we can <unk>
In the case of other disease, the patients and their families have found more research and applying pressure on government, pharmaceutical industry, and <unk>
That was essential to move forward into HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to beat the cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't speak for themselves.
And their families, the CEOs of their loved day, and night, they're often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> that cannot create the change that they need for themselves.
<unk> speaking for them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
So we had this article in the <unk> column in the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with someone, do this.
The paper is a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience when I tested it as a night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strangers are <unk> to be 36 and more personal questions and then both of them look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow in one quality or skill, what would be?
Number one: When was the last time you would remember to another person?
And <unk>
<unk> <unk> these are increasingly personal and more personal.
Number three: <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like about him or her, I know I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you don't say to someone you've just met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a really struck by a really much detail of it, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had a chance to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to <unk>
However, we got <unk> and -- and I thought it was a good story, so I sent it to the love column a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's August, so I guess some of you probably wonder, are they still wondering:
And the reason I think is <unk> this is because they've done this question over and over again in the last seven months.
And this question is what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before the article was published -- I was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had invited myself to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog entry can come to some hundreds of view as a lot, and those were usually only about my friends on Facebook and imagined that my article in the New York Times would be probably some thousands of noticed.
And that came up with a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as he gave it, I had no idea.
The article was printed on a Friday at night, and already Saturday, and this happened in my blog.
And Sunday had been called General Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article received over eight million views, and I was, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust is writing with each other's own experience, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, always, first the same question: still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the mailbox of my email with the phrase, <unk> keep <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers.
I was interviewed in radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable about it.
But I was not prepared for the <unk> of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for San <unk> who included the experiences of readers when I test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first impulse to all this attention was to be very close to my own relationship.
I said not to every petition that we both made a public onset together.
We were <unk> television interviews, and <unk> orders for pictures of us two.
I think I was afraid to become the icons of <unk> from the <unk> process, a range for which I didn't feel at all about it.
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked, they wanted to know if they really <unk> I mean, if it was able to produce love, not just an adventure, but a real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel like to answer.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, especially that people said the wrong question.
How do you know if you were going to get it together or not, and then they <unk>
If the answer was not, I would make the experience of doing these 36 more questions.
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead I was looking for encouraging interpersonal <unk> between college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study worked.
The participants were closer to do that, and then the number of advanced studies, they also used the protocol and <unk> protocol as a rapid way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and community, and they've used it between people of the opposite political ideologies of it.
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer -- that combines personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately never <unk>
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little university in <unk> and then a student came up to me and he told me with <unk> I tried the study and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "Do you want to say that you love the person with whom you will.
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, "But they became better friends?
<unk> that they did have got better to know about the <unk>
<unk>
So, I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the studio for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult <unk>
I had had that relationship since I had 20, which was mostly my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or I could live without him.
So I pushed into science.
And it was all I could find out about the science of romantic love, and I expected that thing to sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I was just looking for the book that I was writing -- but in retrospect, really seems to be <unk>
I thought that if I had to relate to the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and I used to feel like that.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demanding what they are.
But I can also see myself more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm going to look for is sometimes more than I can reasonably help me.
What I'm looking for is a love is a <unk> not just being <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but that I'm going to continue to be caught up in the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media told about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way for some way to mitigate some of the risk of <unk> and this is a very <unk> story, because in love, it makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story version of the story, still follow together?
And its content with a response response, or No.
So more than a question, let's try to ask you more hard questions, questions like, How do you decide who deserves your love and who isn't it?
How do you stay in love with when things got up, and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship?
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good start to have a more <unk> conversation about what it means to love someone.
So, if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we have <unk> we still follow together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love, it's not the same as to stay <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my paper <unk> love didn't happen.
<unk> fell in love because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit when I read it right now, not true, but because at the moment, I hadn't considered everything that was supposed to be.
I didn't think how many times we would have the ones that make that decision, and how much I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always choose or not.
I want you to be enough to have done and responded for 36 questions, have chosen to love someone so generous, and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to convert my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe.
And what you want, and what maybe my life is looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending implicit in my article, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't really wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love someone, and the hope that he also loved me, and it's scary, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by some lesbian <unk> and in a way I came up with a <unk> forest.
<unk> New York City does a time.  One thing that really affected me but more details later.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
And I took a box of wood, and you took a dollar, and a dollar, and a pen and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some kind of weird <unk> or some aliens found this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example, how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
In any case, it has a grace because I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a moment since I was in <unk> <unk> I like to go from <unk> and <unk> and all of those things <unk> and I was making a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took out all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> attached to the style of Agnes Martin, the <unk> of resin and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it is <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking I could <unk>
Instead, it happened the opposite: it somehow seemed to be growing up size, as if it was that I would write the text with a <unk>
So I did I built I built more boxes.
This time, I began to add electronic elements, which were strange bottles that I was finding out of the street, everything I could find out because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow to you -- drawing just like you get around a body in the crime scene.
And I pulled out the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First of all, I think you can make an idea.
Then I made some insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was <unk> man.
At some point I became interested in the human form, the sculptures of natural size with drawings of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was shocked.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass sheets, similar to drawing on a window, then on another window, and another window, and he had all these windows together that formed a three-dimensional composition together.
And this really worked, and I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work with something very big -- I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> Orchard" of <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know it?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of your time.
Well, <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 kilos.
5.5 feet long.
It has a double face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a bit weird.
Well, that's the source of the blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and the <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
You're going from the world of <unk> this <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is where creatures with animals are run by <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the refuge of Osama Bin Laden, there are all sorts of weird things that can be found if you look at very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand comes clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems to be <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of <unk>
It's a little bit of storytelling.
That's the hand in which we <unk>
And then, when you go to the other side, it has a <unk> like a bird peak and spitting out of this <unk>
It also has a 5.5 feet of snake that binds to the <unk>
Anyway, their tail turn on fire on a <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why I did that.
Things that go by, you know.
His tail ends up in a eyeball of <unk> made from terrorist Mother's cards.
Have you <unk>
They were done in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards from terrorists.
It brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
It's about a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a archive of our culture, through media and material to be <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one of you acts as a kind of file in a human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, they come together.
And you can walk between them. It's carrying me.
Each one is basically a microscope of microscope that weighs 1.3 pounds with a dead being trapped inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> he's the chest, you can get the entrance down.
I'm going to see you all over the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall coming out of your chest, and he covers the penis or <unk> or whatever it has -- a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick review of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers you can see.
This is a body in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills coming out and come into the head of this strange statue here.
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these boxes, just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a <unk> box. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physical, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician -- a musician, a musician, a museum, a museum, a museum -- which spreads all the content we do in the world -- and a garden.
It <unk> the box and all the people in the inside of each other like particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that's living on.
And together we get to realize that we are all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very facts about the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start exchanging those things with sweet and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first of the stomach, the guts and other organs.
You will take a pill is the most effective system and <unk> for any drug to make any effect on the body.
The <unk> though, is that when any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take drugs that are <unk> to reduce the amount of viruses in the blood, you will increase the count of stem cells.
But they are also known by their side effects <unk> in their most negative, because in the time that it takes to get to your blood current -- it will be <unk> and worse even for the time it takes to get to your destiny, which is where it's more important in the HIV shop.
These are regions of the body as the lymph <unk> the nervous system, the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go in the bloodstream. of the patients that are tested to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells to infect them.
This is the big problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a life treatment for life that is oral life.
One day, I sat down, and I thought, "Well, let's get the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, not the risk of <unk> of the <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> to care wounds and laparoscopic surgery, they can be used for anything else -- including <unk> transportation of medicines.
In fact, we're already using pulses of laser to open or <unk> and <unk> <unk> and they open up and close holes immediately with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people say, "What is that <unk>
We sent a small and powerful laser beam onto the cell membrane infected with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug into a matter of <unk>
Before you even realize it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology at vitro -- and in vitro plates, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a device in three heads.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to do a <unk> on the site of the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, it's moving into the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the site of infection, whereas the laser is used again to keep the open cells open.
Well, this doesn't look like a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
So this is a dream of a whole researcher in <unk> in our case, a laser <unk>
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups and armed groups like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence from violence and study ways to encourage transition from violent participation to the confrontation of violent <unk>
I do fieldwork in the world of politics and library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost everything in course, because the war has changed.
I used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and non-state actors.
For example, the <unk> peace arrangements between 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we should even be <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflicts.
But how do you do that?
We need to know what this motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do it, how do they do it, but nobody analyzes what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle.
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global picture.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for his violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political game, a social media network and a military network.
Similarly, Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza from 2007.
So these groups make more than just to fire.
They're multitasking out.
They would take a complex machinery of <unk> radio channels, TV channels and Internet websites and strategies in social networks.
And here they have the 3D <unk> magazine in English and published for <unk>
The armed groups also invest in a complex fundraising. They're not <unk> but through <unk> for example, for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit them better and build their brand.
The armed groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, manage hospitals, put professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state doesn't make security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in an Afghanistan named by war or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> can also understand the efforts of these groups to provide safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an elevated price of high school for the population.
But in general, providing social services means filling a <unk> a <unk> gap by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006 in 2006 can't be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage -- even in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill <unk> gaps for the government, and they emerge as armed groups and politicians, participate in violent struggle and they give governance.
And the more complex and the more sophisticated organizations are these organizations, we can less than a state of a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
You get part of a territory, and you run all its <unk> collect the garbage, run the system of <unk>
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is it <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, and we live in a world of <unk> nations, and the more weak of them are the states, as in the Middle East today, and they fill that gap the non-state actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more at the tools not military tools.
It has a government of government to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If we understand better for groups -- we will understand better what incentives to offer to foster violence from violence to non-violence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors, military power can win some battle, but not to give us peace and stability.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill in that vacuum emptiness to fill that vacuum of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept openly the <unk> label would be unfair for the <unk>
I'm a <unk> but pretty bad.
And therefore I would tell you as a bad feminist.
Or at least, I wrote an article and a book called "The <unk> and then in interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke, destined for me and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me take a step back.
When I was a young man, mostly in my youth and 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and they hated sex. Like if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using the people to the <unk> that might be a feminist.
It's going to be <unk> as a feminist was a <unk> a word and unpleasant word.
I love myself as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which takes too much, with high self-worth and <unk> to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until you realize that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I began to accept that I am, in fact, psycho-social and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
Let's get the same for the same job.
We have right to travel around the world as a free violence or violence or violence.
We have right to use easy and accessible the contraceptives and services for <unk>
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without any need for <unk> or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to <unk>
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have to account our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social condition, and so much more.
We have to look at these differences and how we behave in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear, I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make a bad feminist.
I have another confession to do.
When I went to work, I hear rap music <unk> at all volume.
Although the letter degrades the women and offends me, we deeply, the classic <unk> <unk> of the Yin yang of course, is incredible.
<unk> reality with your <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you love the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical music.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The rose is my favorite color.
<unk> of fashion magazines and beautiful things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have <unk> <unk> of <unk> fairy tales, which make reality.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, it is his choice, and I'm not who <unk>
If a woman decides to stay at home to raise his kids, they would raise that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they were <unk>
<unk> this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has bypassed or incapable of historically the needs of the color of color, gay workers, gay workers and <unk> in favor of white, <unk> <unk>
<unk> if that's good feminism -- I'm a very bad feminist here.
It also happens to the following: As a consequence, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope it will be good at perfection.
When we get into the <unk> we take a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I think I was <unk> of that <unk> before I try to put myself in there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid to be tagged like <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> by fear of what that <unk> is for fear of not being able to be able to achieve with a little realistic expectations.
Take an example to <unk> or like I call it, the <unk>
In the last few years, it's a feminist feminist here.
In the <unk> Music <unk> 2014, in <unk> he acted in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a show -- we see this star of the pop star embrace openly Feminism and doing the women and young men that will be feminist is something to be proud to be proud.
<unk> the new cultural critics started endless arguments, if they were <unk> it was not a feminist.
They were looking at their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection is the <unk> because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot, we need so much.
We go much beyond the sensible criticism and constructive for <unk> Feminism of any woman, <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or rather, a more inclusive feminism is the point of <unk>
But what next?
We need to recognize our <unk> to give the action and be a little bit more brave.
If I listen to music -- I am creating a demand for artists that would be happier than happy to provide an limitless.
These artists are not going to change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> affecting change affecting their profits.
It's certainly difficult.
Why does their music have to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when the bad decisions have to justify this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve to be, and it's our responsibility.
I think of three and four years.
It's two girls and <unk> and <unk> and also <unk> I want to grow in a world.
It's where they are affected by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice will be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program deals with sexual violence against women as sport, <unk> the Game of <unk>
We can change the radio <unk> when we hear songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to cinema in another part when movies are not treating women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their classmates like <unk>
In any case, men, especially American men can say, "No, I'm not going to post in your magazine, to participate in his project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a single number of women, both to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a broader range of people.
Those of us who are <unk> but they were trying to participate in these kinds of projects, and we can also encourage us to be including as much as us to be empowered to overcome the barriers to the <unk>
Because we are not <unk> <unk> without these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of courage and expect our decisions to go to the top, people in the power and producers of film and film producers and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also tell our bravery with courage -- well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist to not be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say, especially because the ancient voice my voice was stolen to me and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to address what happened.
A few kids told me, when I was too young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated as if it was anything.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
I got my voice, and after everything I didn't give me to believe that I could say something that could matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of the women who looked like me and understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and as I also discovered that if I was a little brave another woman I could <unk> and see that none of us is the fact that the world tries to tell us we are.
In a hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And on the other, I argue that <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad toaster -- I'm a great woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we all could do the same thing.
I hope that we all could be a little bit courageous, when you need a little bit of <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, I spent children in California had measles for having visited <unk> or being exposed to somebody who had been there.
The virus went through the border with Canada, which is more than 100 children in <unk>
One of the things that we think about this outbreak is that measles that can be lousy for a child with an immune system is one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for over half a century -- but many of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were supposed to be afraid of something that was supposed to be really <unk>
But a moment, it wasn't the article that unleashed the argument on autism and vaccines <unk> <unk> and marked by being a <unk> fraud by the British Medical Center.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
And I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world remain <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the rising estimates of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
And the few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about it believed to develop all their professional life without seeing one single case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates actually continued stable only three or four children per 10,000 <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> of fundraising.
What's going on?
If aren't the vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people to the Centers for Disease Control and what's going on, what is going on, tend to be based on phrases like <unk> <unk> <unk> and "a better detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> numbers.
But that type of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who seeks the face of his son of two years, the visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to be, why were they so reduced to the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened to do with slow progress and <unk> of science that with the <unk> power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what the autism is, and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story starts with a kindergarten psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> who described 11 young patients who looked like <unk> private worlds and <unk> people around them, even their own parents.
They could amuse them for hours for hours by waving their hands before their faces, but they were prey in <unk> as when they don't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as the primary authority of the world in the subject, declared it seen less than 150 cases of his syndrome while <unk> of places as distant as South Africa.
This is actually not surprising because the criteria for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once it was <unk> that he had become nine out of every 10 kids to her office to be autistic without giving them a autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of child <unk> caused by the cold and cold parents.
These kids, he said, they have been carefully kept in a refrigerator that they don't know.
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 kilometers before they turned the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, saying things like the kids were simply <unk> what they had heard their parents were desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Now surprisingly, it wasn't until the decade of 1970 that researchers started to test the <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> psychologist in London, I thought the theory of <unk> mothers was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John was warm and warm people and had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
I knew John and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like <unk> with no special education, no special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To stand for the National Health Service, that they needed more resources for autistic kids and their families, <unk> and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should have been 30 years before.
They launched a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
It was a suburb of London called <unk> to try and find the autistic kids in the community.
What you saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse ones.
Some kids couldn't talk at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the <unk> of the <unk>
In other ways, these kids didn't fit in beautiful <unk> and <unk> as <unk> said and saw a lot more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost for trying to make sense of their data.
How did no one have ever been complaining about these kids before?
But then <unk> found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then he had been <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but he avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation of English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> spoke German, and he was translated to it.
The document provides an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a school school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music exercises with music, and the kids follow their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's that described them as disability, <unk> of life that required <unk> <unk> and space spaces throughout the course of life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called their little teachers, and he started to help in the development of education that were particularly suited to them.
<unk> had seen autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of <unk> and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and always have been, seeing aspects of this continuum in <unk> known in the pop culture as awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even saying that for success in science and art, an ounce of autism is critical.
<unk> and Judith discovered that <unk> was wrong when autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria for the diagnosis that they would make the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the 1980s and early '90s, their changes in <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by a broad and <unk> model.
These changes were not fell in a broken bag.
<unk> when we were <unk> and Judith worked backstage to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I came out with <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what was autism, but after <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> psychologists, teacher and parents around the world knew what the autism was.
At the same time, they were introduced to the earliest clinical trials to use autism.
I had no longer have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these evidence created a network, a perfect storm from autism.
The number of diagnoses started to <unk> as well as predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they hoped that they were hoping out of it, making people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and the services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blaming vaccines for the increase in the <unk> a simple, powerful, seductive history as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of an prevention of preventing one of every 68 children in America are in the spectrum, it's right, the <unk> are one of the world's largest <unk> groups.
In the last few years, autistic people have joined the Internet to refuse to reject the idea that these puzzles are about solving the new medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think of terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's cut.
According to <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a attention deficit to detail.
<unk> people have a hard time to live in a world not built for them.
Seventy years later, we're still reaching <unk> that believed that <unk> for the most successful aspects of autism are found in understanding teachers, employers with capacity, communities communities, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As we go into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
